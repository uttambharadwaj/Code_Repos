A prepaid account requires a $500.00 up front  funds. This is not a charge or deposit. You can spend those funds as soon as you get your card. Going forward, all funds must come in as secured funds. This is bank wire, Western union, self-initiated ACH, or an authorized Check (Comchek, T-check, E-chek).



I have attached WU instructions. Please let me know when you send the funds and I will need a copy of the WU receipt e-mailed or faxed to me. Once I receive the funds I can start processing your file. You should have your cards 7 to 10 days afterwards.



Thank you!!!
