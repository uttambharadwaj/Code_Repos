I have attached a form that I need filled out. Please do so and attached a copy of avoided check. Please secure from your bank a note with your acct # ( US FUNDS ACCT) and routing #.


I apologize for the extra items but we have a specific  problem getting all this correct with the Canadian banking system and We want to avoid any problems that  would interrupt us giving perfect service in the future.



Thank you!!
