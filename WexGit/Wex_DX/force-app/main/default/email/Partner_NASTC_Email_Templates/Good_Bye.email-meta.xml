    <subject>Goodbye from NASTC fuel card program</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for your recent application for a fuel card account!
 
We currently are not able to extend the requested credit line, however, we want you to benefit from the great savings of this NASTC fuel card program!
 
We offer the same program with the same great savings and advantages on a &quot;Prepay&quot; basis, and opening a prepay account is Fast and Easy! The other option is a Letter of Credit from your bank. I am attaching a sample LOC for your bank understanding, if you choose this route.
 
What is required for the prepaid account is a minimum initial deposit of $500.00. We will expedite the account set up and get the card(s) sent to you right away so that you can use the funds you have deposited quickly!
Usually within 7 business days you can have the cards in your hand and start saving money!
 
Payment method on Prepaid account:
 
1. Wire transfer from your bank - Instructions for wire transfer will be sent to you.
 
2. Comchek or T-Chek - Call or email the Comchek or T-Chek number, the amount, and the authorization number. We will run it immediately
 
3 Western Union
 
4. A self-imitated ACH

Thank you!!!
