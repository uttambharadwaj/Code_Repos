    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

I am contacting you to discuss your application for the NASTC fuel card program. As I understand it,  you applied for a credit line and for whatever reason was declined .



Please understand that there are still several additional methods you have to get the NASTC fuel card with the discounts .


1. Resend the application with another signer.

2. Obtain Letter of  credit from your bank (sample attached)

3. Do a prepaid account. (call for exact details)

4. Do a cash Deposit account (call for details)

5. Contact your NASTC Rep asking concerning their factoring program.





If completing a new Electronic Application please do not complete on a cell phone.



All of these methods are good and all will allow you to take advantage of the great savings offered by the good people at NASTC.



Thank you!!!
