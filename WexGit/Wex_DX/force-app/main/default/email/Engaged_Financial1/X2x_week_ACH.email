I have received your application for the Engaged Financial/EFS fuel card. However, the underwriters have some requirements for approval. They want 2 autodraft payments per week and you will not be able to use for cash. Please complete, selecting the 2 different week days you wish to have as your payment days, and return to me as soon as possible. They will start processing your cards as soon as I receive the amended application.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thank you!
