I wanted to take a moment to let you know about our upcoming TA/Petro Webinar with industry expert Homer Hogg as he presents The Value of Regular Preventative Maintenance. 

Learn how to increase your truck's efficiency and control your repair costs by following the 1-10-100 rule. Homer will walk you through a method of categorizing your maintenance services that leads to lowering your overall repair costs, including down time and dollars. Plus, he’ll take time to answer any of your questions!
