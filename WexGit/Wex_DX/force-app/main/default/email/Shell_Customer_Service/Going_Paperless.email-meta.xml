    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},





Follow these easy steps to receive reports or invoices electronically:

1. On the home page, click the Go Paperless icon.

2. Choose your active account, then click Next.

3. A grid appears that lists your active reports. To receive any report electronically, turn off its Paper Delivery option. To go completely paperless, turn them all off.

4. Click Submit.

5. Moving forward, you will receive an email telling you when your invoices and reports are available for download. You can always view these reports online.





Sincerely,
