    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

My name is John Saenz and I&apos;m the Regional Sales Manager for the 7-Eleven Fuel Card Program.

We help businesses like yours save upwards of 15% on overall vehicle management and fueling costs, including competitive fuel rebates on every gallon whenever you fuel at 7-Eleven, regardless of the fuel brand at the pumps.

Whether youâ€™re looking for a fuel card program with easy-set cost controls, in-depth reporting, robust rebates, nationwide card acceptance, or the ability to save hours of administrative time managing your fleet vehicles and expenses, 7-Eleven has an ideal fuel card solution for your business.

I would like to share some additional information about the 7-Eleven Fuel Card Program and speak with you about your current fuel program and needs. I&apos;ll be in touch to schedule some time to meet.

Many thanks,

John Saenz
