    <textOnly>Good Afternoon, 

I hope your week is going well. My name is Preston Bynes with the Chevron and Texaco Business Card Program.  I&apos;d like to know if you have a few minutes available next Wednesday to discuss our solution programs and the benefits and savings we offer? 

We have two tailored programs - our Business Card, which is accepted at nearly 8,000 Chevron and Texaco locations, and our Business Access Card, which in addition offers universal coverage and allows your drivers to fuel at just about any major retail gas station - no matter the brand. Total fuel expense management is easy to track and control, so you can focus on running your business.

If this date is not good for you, please let me know what time works best for you. I am available for a call as well if you need immediate solutions. 

Kind Regards, 

Preston
