    <textOnly>Good Morning {!Lead.FirstName},

My name is {!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName} with the Chevron and Texaco Business Card Program.  I&apos;m going to be in your area next week and I&apos;d like to know if you have a few minutes available to discuss our Business Card Program along with the benefits and savings we offer?

We have two great offerings - Our Business Card, which is accepted at nearly 8,000 Chevron locations, and our Business Access Card, which offers universal coverage, and allows your drivers to fuel at just about any major retail gas station - no matter the brand!

Please let me know what time and day works best.

Already have a Chevron and Texaco Business Card?  Apologies for the confusion.  If you reply to this message with “Already a Business Card Customer” in the Subject line, I will be sure to remove you from future prospecting communications.  Thank you for being a loyal customer. 

Kind Regards,
