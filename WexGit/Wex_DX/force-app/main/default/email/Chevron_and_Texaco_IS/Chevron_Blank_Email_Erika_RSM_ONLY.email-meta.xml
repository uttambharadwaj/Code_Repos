    <subject>Chevron Business Card Meeting - October 2nd-4th</subject>
    <textOnly>Good Afternoon, 

Happy Friday! My name is Erika Stamper with the Chevron and Texaco Business Card Program. I&apos;m going to be in the Phoenix area the week of October 2nd and I&apos;d like to know if you have a few minutes available to discuss our programs along with the benefits and savings we offer?

We have two tailored programs - our Business Card, which is accepted at nearly 8,000 Chevron and Texaco locations, and our Business Access Card, which offers universal coverage and allows your drivers to fuel at just about any major retail gas station - no matter the brand.

Please let me know which day and time works best. :)

Kind Regards,

Erika
