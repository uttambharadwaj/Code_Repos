    <subject>Chevron and Texaco Commercial Fleet Cards - Meeting Tuesday 4/2</subject>
    <textOnly>Good Afternoon, 

My name is Tim Randel with the Chevron and Texaco Business Card Program.  I&apos;d like to know if you have a few minutes available later this week to discuss our commercial fleet card offerings along with the benefits and savings they offer?

Please let me know what time and day works best.

Kind Regards, 

Tim
