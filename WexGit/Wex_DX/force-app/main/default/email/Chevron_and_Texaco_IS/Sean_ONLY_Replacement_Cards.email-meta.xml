    <textOnly>Good Day {!Lead.FirstName},

I’m reaching out regarding a recent card order for your new Chevron and Texaco Business Card account. 

It has come to our attention that the Chevron and Texaco Business cards we recently sent to you were not correctly embossed; specifically the “card number” printed on the back of the card(s) and also the 2nd line of printing (directly below your company name) on the front of your card(s). 

While the card(s) are functional and can be used for now, we have overnighted NEW replacement cards.

UPS Tracking #

Please collect the original cards and distribute the NEW replacement cards as soon as possible.  Be sure to destroy the original (old) cards to insure proper reporting and card transaction details.  We know reporting is an importing part of your day to day! 

Don’t delay in distributing the NEW cards – Your NEW replacement cards are active and ready for fueling.  

We apologize for any inconvenience this error may have caused. If you have any questions, please contact our Customer Advisors at 
1-888-531-3698 if you have additional questions or concerns.
Kind Regards,
