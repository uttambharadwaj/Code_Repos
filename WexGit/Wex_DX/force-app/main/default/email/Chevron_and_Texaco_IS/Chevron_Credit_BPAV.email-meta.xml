    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for your interest in the Chevron and Texaco Business Card Program.


To comply with the Patriot Act, our bank needs you to verify your businessâ€™s physical address for approval.  Please provide documentation from a third party to verify your business is located at the address listed on your application.


To pass verification, the bank requires a copy of one of the following documents:

A copy of a Utility bill or invoice (i.e. telephone or power) showing that the bill is mailed to the physical street address or that it services the physical address of the business

Lease agreement that identifies the business and the physical street address of the business

Certified articles of incorporation that identifies the physical street address

An unexpired government-issued business license; a partnership agreement; or a trust instrument that identifies the physical street address

A copy of an invoice (paper supplies, lumber, etc.) that documents delivery to the physical street address as it appears on the credit application

Bank account statement that identifies the physical street address

Business name needs to match the name on the application and documents need to be no older than 60 days. 


Feel free to scan and email the verification to me at the email noted below, or if you prefer, you can fax it to me at {!User.Fax}.  You can also call me at {!User.Phone} should you have any questions.

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
