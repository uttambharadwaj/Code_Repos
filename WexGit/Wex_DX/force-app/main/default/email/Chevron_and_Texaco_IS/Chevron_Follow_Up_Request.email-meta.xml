    <textOnly>Good Morning {!Lead.FirstName},


I wanted to follow up with you in regards to our Chevron and Texaco Business Card Program.

Do you have a few minutes available next week for me to stop by and discuss how we may be able to benefit your company?

Please let me know what time and day works best.

Already have a Chevron and Texaco Business Card?  Apologies for the confusion.  If you reply to this message with “Already a Business Card Customer” in the Subject line, I will be sure to remove you from future prospecting communications.  Thank you for being a loyal customer. 

Kind Regards,
