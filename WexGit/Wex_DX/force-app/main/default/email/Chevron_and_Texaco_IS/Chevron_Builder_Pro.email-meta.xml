    <subject>Exciting News About Your Chevron and Texaco Business Card</subject>
    <textOnly>Good Morning,

I’m reaching out on behalf of the Chevron and Texaco Business Card program and some exiting new regarding your account! Recently Chevron has tasked WEX to manage its fleet card program, you should have already received some information about the transition, and what it means to your business. We wanted to take this time to reach out and learn more about how you’re currently utilizing all the benefits your card offers. I’d like to setup a time to connect by phone, please let me know what date and time would work best to do so. If you’d prefer to communicate electronically please answer this brief questionnaire about your account so we can learn how to best serve you and your business. 

How many cards do you currently use? 

Do you have one card for each vehicle or are your cards assigned to the drivers? 

Do you allow your drivers to make purchases aside from fuel? 

If yes, what type or purchases are your drivers making? 

Are you currently utilizing the online tool for account management? 

Thank you,
