    <textOnly>Good Afternoon, 

Happy Friday ! My name is Francesca Ragazzone  and I am with the Chevron and Texaco business card program. I am going to be in your area next week and I&apos;d like to know if you have a few minutes available to meet with me to discuss your business. I&apos;d like to determine how we might potentially tailor a fleet card program to save you time and money on fuel expenses.

 

In addition to Chevron and Texaco, we also have universal card options that give you access to 95% of fueling locations, including ExxonMobil, Shell, and 76.

 

Please select a time that works for you to meet using my calendar link, here: https://calendly.com/francesca-ragazzone. If none of my available times work for you, please let me know so we can try to work something else out.

 

I&apos;m looking forward to hearing from you soon. Have a great day.

Kind Regards, 

Francesca
