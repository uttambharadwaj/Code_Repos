    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to reach out to you one last time to see if you are still considering the Chevron and Texaco Business Card Program.

Apply by July 31, 2020 for our Business Access Card and earn a 3¢ per gallon rebate* on all gallons at Chevron and Texaco stations for as long as you use the Access card!

It’s easy to enroll. Simply complete the attached application form, and fax it to me at {!User.Fax}. You can also scan and then email the form back to me at the email noted below.

You can find a complete list of accepting locations at https://www.chevronwithtechron.com/station/

Chevron and Texaco Business Access Card is accepted at over
45,000 vehicle maintenance locations nationwide.

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Already have a Chevron and Texaco Business Card?  Apologies for the confusion.  If you reply to this message with “Already a Business Card Customer” in the Subject line, I will be sure to remove you from future prospecting communications.  Thank you for being a loyal customer. 

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}

*Applications must be received by July 31, 2020. The 3¢ per gallon rebate will begin from gallon one and apply to each gallon purchased at Chevron and Texaco locations using the Business Access Card. Rebates will appear as an account credit on your billing statement. Rebates are subject to change at any time without prior notice. Not valid on aviation, bulk fuel, propane or natural gas purchases.
