I wanted to take a moment and thank you for being a valued WEX Telematics customer. We want to educate you on the sunset of AT&Tâ€™s 2G service and how it will impact vehicles with Telematics installed in your fleet.

As you may be aware AT&T is discontinuing its 2G service in a phased approach. The 2G coverage shutdown has begun and will continue through December 31, 2016. This has zero impact on the functionality of your WEX Fuel Cards whatsoever. However, this means that your AT&T 2G devices will need to be replaced with upgraded hardware before the shutdown in your area.
To help avoid an unexpected lapse in your WEX Telematics reporting, we are proactively reaching out to our affected WEX Telematics customers. To that end we will work with you to provide new devices and compatible harnesses. 

Our records indicate that you have GPS devices that will need to be migrated. WEX Telematics is committed to making this transition as seamless as possible with minimal impact to your business. We have a dedicated team that will work with you on this transition. 

Please respond with an appropriate day and time for our 2G task force to connect with you to review how the 2G network retirement impacts your WEX Telematics program. In the meantime, please call <WEX REP TELE NUMBER> and we will be happy to assist.
