    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;m following up on my recent message regarding this month&apos;s WEXSMART savings opportunity.  In addition to the immediate fuel savings, I thought I&apos;d share some statistics that might help build your business case from a recent industry study*:  

* Cut fuel consumption by an estimated $1,000 per vehicle, per year
* Decrease vehicle maintenance costs by an average of 13%
* Monitor dangerous driving &amp; speeding - reduce accidents by approximately 38%

REMINDER: Save 10 cents per gallon for three months** with WEXSMART

Order before December 15th, 2011, and you may be eligible for a 10 cent fueling rebate for your fleet account.  

I would appreciate the opportunity to arrange a 20-minute online demonstrate.  See first hand how WEXSMART can help your specific situation.  

Sincerely,
