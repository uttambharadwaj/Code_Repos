    <subject>Simplify Your Fleet Management with WEX Telematics</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Primary_Contact_First_Name__c},

I am following up on our communication around WEX Telematics. Our telematics solution integrates seamlessly with your WEX fuel card, creating a powerful tool that provides greater control and allows you to:

*Better coach drivers, resulting in reduced fuel costs, lower insurance premiums, and increased safety.
*Track assets to prevent theft.
*Take greater control of maintenance scheduling to avoid costly breakdowns and keep your fleet running optimally.

I would love to have a conversation with you about how WEX Telematics can simplify your job and save your company money. When would be a good time to reach out to you?

Sincerely,
