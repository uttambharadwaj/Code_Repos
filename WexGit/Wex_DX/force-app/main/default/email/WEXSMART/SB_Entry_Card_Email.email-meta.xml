    <textOnly>Thank you for your interest in our Wright Express fuel card programs. As we discussed earlier today, we do offer a business card program which includes many of the same features of our Fleet Card program, but simplified in areas especially for businesses like yours.  Following are some highlights:

Acceptance – The card is accepted at more than 90% of retail fuel merchants nationwide. You also have the option to allow your cards to be accepted at an additional 35,000 service merchant locations.

Ease of Use – The driver is only required to enter the correct Driver Identification Number at the pump and then fuel.

Real Savings – Always find the lowest prices and save at the pump using our mobile device and online tools.

Online Management – You can manage your cards, view reports and even pay your bill online.

Administrative Aid – All fuel charges and vehicle related expenses appear on one invoice.

Customer Service – With Wright Express you get live, U.S. based customer service for you and your drivers, 24/7.

If you have any questions, or would like additional details about this program, please give me a call at &lt;telephone number&gt;
