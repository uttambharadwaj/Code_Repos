    <textOnly>Save 10 cents per gallon for three months* with WEXSMART

Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to make you aware of a unique savings opportunity with Wright Express&apos;s GPS telematics solution -- WEXSMART.  Now through December 15th, 2011, qualifying orders can help you earn a 10 cent rebate on your fleet account&apos;s fueling purchases for three months.

WEXSMART can help you save year round by:

* Reducing unauthorized vehicle uses like idling, speeding or off-hours use
* Decreasing vehicle maintenance costs
* Improving fleet productivity and re-deploying resourcesNEW! Easily identify potential fuel card misuse.  
* Spot situations where your Wright Express fuel card is used an unreasonable distance from your vehicle locations. 

I will follow-up by phone in the next two days to see if you would be interested in hearing more about how WEXSMART can help your fleet.  Please let me know if there is someone else I should talk to at your organization regarding this opportunity. 

Sincerely, 
{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
