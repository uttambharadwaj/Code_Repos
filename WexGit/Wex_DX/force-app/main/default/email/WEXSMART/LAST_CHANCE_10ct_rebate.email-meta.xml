Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to remind you about a unique savings opportunity with Wright Express&apos;s GPS telematics solution -- WEXSMART.  Through June 30, 2011, qualifying orders can help you earn a 10 cent rebate on your fleet&apos;s fueling purchases for three months.


Hopefully you have had a chance to review the materials we sent you.  These materials are only a starting point to see how you can save on your fleet&apos;s operating cost and improve productivity.

I would like to set up a FREE 20 minute personal demo next week and answer any specific questions you may have.  I will call you next week to schedule a time.  

Sincerely, 
{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
