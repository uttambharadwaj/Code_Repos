    <subject>Additional information is needed to process your application</subject>
    <textOnly>In order to qualify for credit, you may either submit financial statements for your business or have an officer of the company sign a Personal Guarantee.

If you choose to send financial statements, I will need one full year of financial records. This consists of your balance sheet and income statement.

Should you prefer to submit a Personal Guarantee, simply complete the attached form and fax it back to me at {!User.Fax}.

Also, as required by the Patriot Act, Credit is requesting “physical address verification”. We need a copy of a utility bill or other formal document listing your legal business name and the physical address you provided on the application.

Please call me with any questions.

Thank you for choosing the SA Fleet Card Program.


Sincerely,
