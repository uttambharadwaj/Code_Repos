    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to reach out to you one last time to see if you are still considering the SA Fleet Card program.


Itâ€™s easy to enroll. Simply complete the attached application form, and fax it to me at {!User.Fax}. You can also scan and then email the form back to me at the email noted below.

You can find a complete list of accepting locations at http://superamerica.com/locations/ .

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Thank you for your interest in the SA Fleet Card program.
