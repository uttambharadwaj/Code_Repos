    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for your time today.


I&apos;ve attached the fee comparison as discussed.  This comparison is based upon the most recent Aline Card fee schedule I currently have on hand.  You may have a different version provided by ADP.  Please let me know if there are discrepancies or you may send me ADP&apos;s fees to me, and I&apos;ll update the comparison for you.

I have highlighted the areas where one program provides benefit over the other.  Once reviewed, and presuming I&apos;ve accurately portrayed the ADP fee structure,  I think you&apos;ll have to agree, that the WEX rapid! PayCard provides your employees a far greater benefit when compared to ADP&apos;s Aline program.

While a good place to start, fees are only the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot;.  I hope after you&apos;ve reviewed the attached,  you&apos;ll give some consideration into taking a closer look at the rapid! PayCard offering.

As you suggested, I&apos;ll touch base again sometime late next week, and we&apos;ll see what, if any, next steps would be appropriate.

Best wishes,
