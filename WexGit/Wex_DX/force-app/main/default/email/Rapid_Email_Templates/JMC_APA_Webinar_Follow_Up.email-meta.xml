    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;


Thank you for attending our APA webinar, on “How to eliminate payroll checks with PayCards” earlier this month.  We hope it met your expectations and that you came away with a better understanding of paycards and their benefits to the employer and employee.

I am contacting you to see if you&apos;re still issuing and distributing &quot;paper paychecks&quot; and are interested in investigating whether paycards might fulfill a need for {!Lead.Company}.


If you are already issuing paycards in your organization, would you be open to comparing programs? I am confident you will find benefits in the rapid! PayCard program you do not have today.


I&apos;ve attached a a recent article from the APA and the NCLC regarding paycards and suggested guidelines to follow. Enclosed are a few links to additional information that you might find of value.
