What is significant about this date?  This is the day that Assembly Bill No.720 goes into effect and you will be able to mandate direct deposit for all employee compensation.


In 2013, the Federal Government chose to go paperless eliminating all Federal Benefits, SSI, and Income Tax checks for an estimated 1 Billion dollars in savings over the next few years!


Not only does being 100% direct deposit have many benefits for the employer, but offering a pay card has many benefits for the employees as well.


With the WEX rapid! PayCard program you will be able to offer a FREE employee benefit. There is absolutely no cost to you the employer and pratically nothing for the employee as well.  In some cases it is even cheaper than traditional banking!


WEX Inc was founded almost 40 years ago. We are a publically owned company traded on the NYSE as WEX. We are a leading provider of physical, digital and virtual payment card solutions.


WEX rapid PayCard services over 20 Public (County and District) school systems throughout the US. The 8th largest school district, Hillsbourough County Public Schools, has been a big advocate of ours for years (See attached document.)


I would greatly appreaciate the opportunity to answer your questions and explain more!
If there is a more appropriate person that I should talk to please forward them this email, or respond to me whom I should speak with.
