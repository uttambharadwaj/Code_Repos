    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},


It was nice speaking with you today.


As we discussed, I’d like to prepare an  estimated cost &amp; environmental savings analysis for {!Account.Name} . In order to do so, I’ll need you answer a few questions (see below).  If there are any questions you are not comfortable responding to just skip them. As for the ones you’re not sure on, a reasonable guess will do.


1. Total employees?

2. Total employees receiving paper check?

3. How many locations are checks sent to?

4. How are they sent, regular mail, 2nd day or overnight mail?

5. How often to do process payroll (i.e. weekly, bi-weekly etc.)?

6. Average check amount for employees not on direct deposit?

7. Estimated rate of employee turnover?

8. How many people process payroll?

9. Annual gross revenue?

10. Net Profit % (if you’re not comfortable responding to this one leave blank)?


Once you’ve responded, I’ll get to work and should have a response for you pretty quickly.  I’ll also make available to you the spreadsheet I use to calculate the savings. That way you’ll have the ability to fine tune the numbers and come to a more exact conclusion.


Thanks for your help,
