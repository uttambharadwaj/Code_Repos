    <textOnly>Good Afternoon {!Lead.FirstName},

My name is {!User.Name} and I am with WEX, Inc, providers of the rapid! Visa Payroll Card.

The rapid! PayCard provides companies nationwide with the most comprehensive PayCard benefit. An ePayroll program designed for employers choosing to eliminate, costly &amp; inefficient paper checks from their payroll process. This ZERO cost program was created for those employees currently not on direct deposit and who may not qualify for, or want, a bank account.

I wanted to take a moment to reach out to you to see if we can schedule a time to chat briefly on the phone sometime next week.  The purpose of the call would be to determine if our program might fulfill a need for {!Lead.Company}, and provide you with some additional information if warranted.

How does your calendar look for next week?  If a particular day and time works best for you, please let me know and I will work around your schedule.

I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.
