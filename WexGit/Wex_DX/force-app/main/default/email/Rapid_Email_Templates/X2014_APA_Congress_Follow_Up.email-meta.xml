    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


I wanted to touch base and thank you for attending APA Congress, if you were a &apos;virgin&apos; I hope it was everything you were expecting and more!!



I am sure you are busy this week getting back into the swing of things, so I will contact you next week as follow up, to see ... A) If you&apos;re still issuing and distributing &quot;paper paychecks&quot;, and B) to see if you&apos;re interested in investigating whether paycards might fulfill a need for {!Lead.Company}.


In the meantime.. I&apos;ve attached a a recent article from the APA and the NCLC regarding paycards and suggested guidelines to follow.



Below are a few links to additional information that you might find of value.
