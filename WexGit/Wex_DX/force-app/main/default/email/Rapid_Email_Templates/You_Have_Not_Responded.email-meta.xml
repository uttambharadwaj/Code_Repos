    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I have made a number of attempts to contact you (via e-mail and/or by phone) and you have not responded.

If there is any interest in exploring the “zero cost” rapid! PayCard program, and how it will benefit {!Account.Name} &amp; its employees, please let me know so we can stay in touch. If you&apos;ve already made other plans, or just prefer that I don&apos;t contact you further, please let me know that as well.

If you’ll please just tell me if I should quietly disappear or stay in touch. Either way, I&apos;ll happily comply.

A few links below to catch up if you&apos;d like.
