I am a Strategic Account Manager for WEX, Inc. and I specifically work with Fortune 1000 companies.  WEX listens, WEX innovates, WEX solves and WEX serves up solutions with always available high touch customer service.

I would like to determine where your issues exist with a short discovery call and then we can customize the solutions that will benefit your company with the most impact. This is the calendar quarter that most companies focus of budgets for 2015 and our solutions can promise cost savings and operational efficiencies with zero monetary investment in the solutions.

Below is a summary of the suite of WEX payment solutions, and how WEX provides benefit to you?

Can we put a 5 to 10 minute phone call on your calender?
