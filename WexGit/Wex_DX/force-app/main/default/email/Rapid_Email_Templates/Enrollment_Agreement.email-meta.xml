    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Please find attached for review and possible signature the rapid! PayCard enrollment agreement and fee schedule.

When you’re ready, please sign the agreement and initial all pages of the fee schedule. Please then scan all pages, into a single document, and email back to me.

As soon as I receive both the arrangement back, I will get you set up with one of our enrollment specialists who will guide you through training and implementation.

Of course, I will always be a resource to you as well.  Please don’t hesitate to call on me with any questions.


Best Regards,
