    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},


Recently someone with {!Lead.Company} visited our website for an extended period of time. Quite honestly I have no idea who it was.  Often, it’s simply an employee of yours who happens to be a rapid! PayCard holder and is accessing the website for variety of reasons.

However, on the off chance it was someone in your payroll or HR department that might be investigating the merits of paycard implementation, I thought I’d touch base directly.  If not, please allow me to apologize in advance for this intrusion….Btw, my name is Matt Merriam and I’m a prepaid product specialist with WEX rapid! PayCard.

Assuming paycards are being considered, I’ve included a link below to some information that you might find of value.  If not, again forgive me.



If there is an interest in exploring this FREE employee benefit and what we have to offer, please let me know so we can stay in touch. If you&apos;ve already have a paycard program in place, or simply prefer that I don&apos;t contact you further, please let me know that as well. Either way, I’ll happily comply.

Best Wishes,


Matt Merriam
