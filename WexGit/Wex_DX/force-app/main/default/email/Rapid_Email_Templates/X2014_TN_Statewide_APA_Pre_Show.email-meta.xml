Avoid the hassle of filling out

If you&apos;d like to earn RCH credits &amp; learn more about paycards &amp; paperless pay, please be sure to join us for our speaking session on Thursday, August 14th at 10:50am. During our discussion you&apos;ll learn how paycard &amp; pre-paid card growth is trending, what to look for and expect from your current or future paycard provider. Additionally, you&apos;ll learn the common obstacles companies encounter when trying to promote paycard use, and more importantly how to overcome them.
