    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


I just wanted to shoot you a quick note and thank you for stopping our booth last week during the Burger King Convention.  It&apos;s my understanding that you took a moment to meet with John Laudani and Art Kimball to discuss the WEX rapid! PayCard program.  My name is Matt Merriam, and as the rapid! PayCard representative in your area,  John asked that I follow up with you directly and introduce myself.



As follow up, I will be in touch with you in the next couple of days to see if you have any initial questions and to discuss any potential next steps, if appropriate.



In the mean time I&apos;ve attached is some information about the WEX rapid! PayCard program for your review. and below is my direct contact information as well.



Best wishes,

Matt Merriam
