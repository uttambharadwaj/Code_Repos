    <textOnly>Dear { }


If you still issue paper checks to some employees, we should slate a time frame to talk.  Your industry has been a great fit for this solution and here are some reasons why:

• Paycards allow managers to focus on more productive activities on payday

• Paycards save time

• Paycards reduce overall payroll costs

• Paycards minimize exposure to check fraud

• Paycards benefit your employees

You simply setup direct deposit in payroll for employees that are issued pay cards. Please let me know when we can connect and I will follow up accordingly.




Sincerely,</textOnly>
