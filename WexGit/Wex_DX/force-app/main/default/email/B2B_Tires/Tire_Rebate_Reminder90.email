I wanted to make sure you're taking advantage of our tire rebate program by reminding you that if you haven't faxed or emailed in your recent tire invoices, you have 2 full months after the month you bought them to send them in for a rebate.

We offer rebates on Goodyear and Yokohama commercial truck tires purchased from an authorized dealer.  Negotiate your best price on the tires and simply send us a copy of the invoice. We'll process your rebate check the following month, provided no issues with the tire invoice.  You can see more details by visiting http://truckersb2b.com/Savings/Tires

If you have any questions, or are no longer purchasing Goodyear or Yokohama tires, please give me a call so we can discuss how we might be able to save you on other brands.
