Just wanted to remind you that if you haven't faxed or emailed in your recent tire invoices, you have 2 full months after the month you bought them to send them in for a rebate.

We offer rebates on Goodyear and Yokohama commercial truck tires purchased from an authorized dealer.  Negotiate your best price on the tires and simply send us a copy of the invoice. We'll process your rebate check the following month, provided no issues with the tire invoice.  You can see more details by visiting http://truckersb2b.com/Savings/Tires

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.  I look forward to helping you save on your tires, fuel, oil, dispatch software, office supplies and more.

Thank you for being a member,
