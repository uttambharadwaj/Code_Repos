    <textOnly>Hello!

Your Sales Onboarding is starting on {!Case.Class_Start_Date_del__c}.

I want to take this opportunity to welcome you and say how excited I am that you will be a part of the WEX Family.

You are getting ready to undertake the incredible learning process through WEX Sales University. By the end of training, you will have a greater understanding of WEX and it&apos;s processes.

Items to remember:

On Day One, arrive at 8:00am at {!User.Street} {!User.City}, {!User.State} {!User.PostalCode}.
If you have NOT finalized your paperwork with HR, bring your two forms of ID to complete the Federal I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form.
The dress policy is business professional.  You may wear business casual attire during training but we do have you role play a sales meeting that many past Reps have preferred to wear business attire to complete.
A group dinner has been scheduled for Wednesday night.  All other dinners will be on your own at any of the many fine area restaurants.


Please donâ€™t hesitate to call me or Salestraining@wexinc.com with any questions. I look forward to our training next week.
