    <textOnly>By now, your Manager should have shared with you WEX’s plans to make an investment in strengthening our sales process discipline. The Sales Training Team has been actively involved in selecting the structured sales methodology to be adopted, as well as in the design of the learning curriculum. We are confident this new discipline will fundamentally change the way we manage our key accounts while elevating the quality of every interaction we have with clients and prospects.

Miller Heiman’s Large Account Management Process (LAMP) will be introduced across the sales organization in MONTH. We chose this particular methodology for its proven ability to elevate key customer relationships on a sustained basis. LAMP has been successfully implemented by hundreds of companies, including many of the Fortune 100. It is specifically aimed at addressing the challenges of maintaining and growing large accounts involving multiple decision makers and, as such, should serve the needs of our business very well.

Transferring the knowledge gained into practice will be both challenging and critical. This won’t happen in the classroom no matter how talented and engaging the instructors. It will take a commitment to thorough preparation prior to training, active participation during the workshops, and superior dedication by you to adopt the principles and concepts and incorporate them into your daily business routines.

I urge you to vigorously embrace this new sales process methodology. You will find it to be simple, intuitive, and highly effective for managing your large accounts. It also represents the first of several steps we will take along the path to achieving our strategic objective of becoming the partner of choice for our customers by consistently outperforming our competition.
