    <textOnly>Please hold this time for Kathryn Connolly to roll out the Sales Performance Assessment (SPA) and hand out individual results.

SPA provides inâ€“depth feedback on the behaviors and sales drivers of the contemporary sales professional. The model represents 18 sales behaviors and 6 sales drivers. The application can be used to develop sales professionals, develop sales teams and may also be used as a component in the sales selection process. The MRG certified in-house Sales Trainer uses the results of the assessment to help develop individuals through training and development, coaching, and talent management programs directly.

Background: Sales Intelligence is a process designed to aid an organization to better understand its current sales culture; to articulate the ideal sales profile required to move forward; to select candidates better matched to the ideal; to evaluate each individual salesperson to determine a Sales Action Plan; and finally, to establish an organizational structure to continuously support the process.

Sales success profiles for WEX sales roles have been created and will be used in multiple ways to help meet our sales goals moving forward by:


Creating a sales success profile that allows current employees to build a more meaningful sales action plan
Helping individuals line up their own talents and skills with the appropriate job at WEX


Our goal is to capitalize on the strengths you bring to the team as well as put in place a Sales Action Plan related to your development opportunities.  We want to ensure you continued success and grow your skills and talents as it relates to your work at WEX.



Thank you,
