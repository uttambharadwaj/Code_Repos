Hi ,

I&apos;m just checking in to see how you&apos;re doing on completing your Learning Plan Phase II Corporate Payments (https://wexinc.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/700000009EOI/a/0g000000H2uy/fCkk0cnJjPFHlaRXStOhMDxKCdTRNlcP0gpb1Q5odnA).

Once you&apos;ve fully reviewed the Learning Plan, take the Knowledge Check (https://forms.gle/hRLqTVZSnL1uvVj57) to indicate that you&apos;ve completed this training.

Please let me know any if you have any questions.

Thank You,
