    <subject>Large Account Management Process Training Invitation</subject>
    <textOnly>Our next two-day Large Account Management Process (LAMP) training is scheduled to start on {!Case.Class_Start_Date_del__c} in our Portland, Maine training facility.

I urge you to communicate your expectations to your team to participate in this learning experience. Please respond by {!Case.MGR_Pre_Call_Date__c} to enroll any employee who will benefit from this program who hasnâ€™t attended.


Overview:
LAMP is an investment in our sales process discipline and sales professionals. The Sales Training Team has been actively involved in providing this structured sales methodology to sales professionals who manage WEX key accounts for the past 4 years. We are confident this discipline will fundamentally change the way your team manages key accounts by elevating the quality of every interaction they have with our clients.


To be thought leaders in the changing times ahead, we must demonstrate three broad capabilities:


1) A clear and early view of market needs

2) A thorough understanding of the implication of those needs

3) The agility to satisfy them more rapidly than our competitors


LAMP has been successfully implemented by hundreds of companies, including many of the Fortune 100. It is specifically aimed at addressing the challenges of maintaining and growing large accounts involving multiple decision makers and, as such, should serve the needs of our business very well.
