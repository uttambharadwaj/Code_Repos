    <textOnly>Thank you so much for your passion, commitment to your development, your team’s development and the success of WEX! I had such a great week with you all and I look forward to seeing your final plans. As promised, here is the email capturing your next steps in completing the program. The 2020 Strategic Plan Template is attached. I also attached the PowerPoint version for those managers who would like to present this to your teams at the sales meeting in 2020. 



I will go ahead and schedule a reminder on your calendars for the dates below. As we discussed during training, blocking time on your calendar will allow you to focus and complete your plan.
