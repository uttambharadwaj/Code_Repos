    <textOnly>The Global Sales Training Team is excited to be offering onsite the Miller Heiman’s Large Account Management Process (LAMP) training. We chose this particular methodology for its proven ability to elevate key customer relationships on a sustained basis. It is specifically aimed at addressing the challenges of maintaining and growing large accounts involving multiple decision makers and, as such, should serve the needs of our business very well.


Transferring the knowledge gained into practice will be both challenging and critical. This won’t happen in the classroom no matter how talented and engaging the instructors. It will take a commitment to prepare prior to training, active participation during the workshops, and superior dedication by you to adopt the principles and concepts and incorporate them into your daily business routines.


I urge you to embrace this new process. You will find it to be simple, intuitive, and highly effective for managing your large accounts. It also represents the first of several steps we will take along the path to achieving our strategic objective of becoming the partner of choice for our customers by consistently outperforming our competition.


Action Required: Participation in the launch session is required to review the pre-work for the upcoming classroom training. If for any reason you cannot attend the training please contact Kathryn Connolly immediately.


The attachments will be reviewed during the WebEX Launch Session scheduled on DATE. Please print and review prior to the meeting.


Please contact me if you have any questions.


Thank You,
