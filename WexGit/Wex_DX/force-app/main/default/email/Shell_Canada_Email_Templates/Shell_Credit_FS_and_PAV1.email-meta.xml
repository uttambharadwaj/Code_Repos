    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing the Shell Fuel Card Program.

In order to process your application, Credit is requesting a copy of your financial statements. You will need to send one full year of financial records, including your balance sheet and income statement.

Also, to comply with the Patriot Act, our bank needs you to verify your physical address for approval.  Please provide documentation from a third party to verify your business is located at the correct address listed on your application.

To pass verification, the bank requires a copy of one of the following documents:

- Utility bill or insurance document showing that the bill is mailed to the physical street address or that it services the physical address of the business
- Lease agreement which identifies the business and the physical address of the office
Certified articles of incorporation
- An unexpired government-issued business license


Feel free to scan and email the verification to me at the email address noted below, or if you prefer, you can fax it to me at {!User.Fax}.  You can also call me at {!User.Phone} if you have any questions.


Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
{!User.Title}
Phone - {!User.Phone}
