    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in the Shell Fuel Card Program.

Below you will find some additional information about our Shell Fuel Card Program to help you consider our widely accepted Shell Fuel Card as the one-card solution for all your fueling needs.

- We save you money. Robust fuel rebates at all Shell locations.
- We save you time. You’ll enjoy the convenience of a single fueling card program and one, easy-to-read invoice. You can also easily download transaction data from the web right to QuickBooks or Excel each month.
- We give you control. Detailed reports show how and where you spent your fueling money, so you can account for every penny.
- We make it convenient. Your drivers only need to carry one card to fuel and save at any participating location.

It’s easy to enroll. Simply complete the attached application form and fax it back to me at {!User.Fax}. You can also scan and email the form back to me at the email address below.

Sincerely,
