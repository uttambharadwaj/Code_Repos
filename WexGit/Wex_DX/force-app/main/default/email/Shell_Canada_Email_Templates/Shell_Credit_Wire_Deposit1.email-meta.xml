    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As we discussed, I am attaching the form with the necessary information to send a deposit via wire transfer (rather than a certified check).

Please notify me of the amount and the date you wire the funds.

Also, please fax the deposit form to me at {!User.Fax}. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.


Thank you for choosing the Shell Fuel Card program.

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
