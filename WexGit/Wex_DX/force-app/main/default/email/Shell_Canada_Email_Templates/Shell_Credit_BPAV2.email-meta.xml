    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in the Shell Fuel Card Program.

To comply with the Patriot Act, our bank needs you to verify your business’s physical address for approval.  Please provide documentation from a third party to verify your business is located at the address listed on your application.

To pass verification, the bank requires a copy of one of the following documents:


- Utility bill or insurance document showing that the bill is mailed to the physical street address or that it services the physical address of the business
- Lease agreement which identifies the business and the physical address of the office
- Certified articles of incorporation
- An unexpired government-issued business license


Feel free to scan and email the verification to me at the email noted below, or if you prefer, you can fax it to me at {!User.Fax}.  You can also call me at {!User.Phone} should you have any questions.

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
{!User.Title}
Phone - {!User.Phone}
