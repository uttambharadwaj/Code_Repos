    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for applying for our Shell Fuel Card Program!

In order to enroll, you must submit a Personal Authorization, attached. An officer of your company must complete and sign the form, which you can either scan/email or fax back to me once completed.

To comply with the Patriot Act, our bank is requesting you verify your physical address for approval.  Please provide documentation from a third party to verify your business is located at the correct address listed on your application.

To pass verification, the bank requires a copy of one of the following documents:
- Utility bill or insurance document showing that the bill is mailed to the physical street address or that it services the physical address of the business
- Lease agreement which identifies the business and the physical address of the office
- Certified articles of incorporation
- An unexpired government-issued business license

Feel free to scan and email the verification to me at the email address noted below, or if you prefer, you can fax it to me at {!User.Fax}.  You can also call me at {!User.Phone} if you have any questions.

Sincerely,


{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
{!User.Title}
Phone - {!User.Phone}
