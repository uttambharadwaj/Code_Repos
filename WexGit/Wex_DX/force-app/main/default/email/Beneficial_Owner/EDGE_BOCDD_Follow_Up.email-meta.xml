    <textOnly>Hello {!OnlineApplication__c.Contact_First_Name__c}

Thank you for taking the time to discuss your {LOB} application with me today.  For your convenience, I’ve attached the Beneficial Ownership of Customer Due Diligence Form (BOCDD) we discussed as well as a link to the BOCDD FAQ&apos;s to assist with any questions you may have in regards to this new federal regulation.  Once you’ve completed the attached form, please email it back to me at my email address listed below in order for WEX Bank to continue processing your application.
