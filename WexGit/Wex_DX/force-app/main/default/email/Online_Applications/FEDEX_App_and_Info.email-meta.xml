    <textOnly>Greetings {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for your interest in the EFS FedEX fuel card program!

For your convenience, I have provided the credit application document packet with this email. You have already ordered the cards by completing the docu-sign, but these application materials are also required in order to move forward.

Please find attached:

- EFS FedEx Credit Application
- Bank Authorization Form (a voided check is required)
- WEX Personal Guaranty Form
- Beneficial Owner Short Form (government required document)



We look forward to a long relationship with {!Account.Name}. And again, thank you for your interest in EFS. If you have any questions about the application or your new fuel card program, please donâ€™t hesitate to call or email me.


Warm Regards,
