    <textOnly>Dear {!OnlineApplication__c.Contact_Name__c},

Thank you for your interest in the WEX Fleet One fuel card. It appears you began the application process, but have not completed it. For your convenience, I&apos;ve included a link to our online application so that you may complete the process at your convenience. Please note that the name listed on the Business Service Agreement (BSA) must be exactly the same as the individual whose electronic signature is on the EchoSign.

Please click here and follow the instructions to complete your application process.

We look forward to a long relationship with {!OnlineApplication__c.Legal_Business_Name__c}. And again, thank you for your interest in WEX Fleet One. If you have any questions about the application or your new fuel card program, please donâ€™t hesitate to call or email me.
