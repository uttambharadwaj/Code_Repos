    <textOnly>Hello -


I am following-up in regards to some information that was recently sent to you about the new Fuelbook Select fuel card program powered by WEX Fleet One.  This offer was sent to a select group of potential customers and allows you to be pre-approved for a credit line for fuel (based on how many trucks/vehicles you are currently running).&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;


The Fuelbook Select fuel card program offers a discount at Pilot/Flying J as well as other additional benefits.  Please reach out to me via email or phone if you would like to apply or if you have any questions/concerns.



Sincerely,


Joni Crockarell
