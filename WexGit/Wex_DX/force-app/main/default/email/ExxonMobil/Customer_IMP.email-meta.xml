Your new fleet fueling cards are on the way and will be arriving within 5 to 7 business days via US Mail.  When they arrive, they will be active and ready to use with the driver ID numbers that you provided to me.  

While awaiting the arrival of the cards, I encourage you to set up your online account at www.ExxonMobilUniversalOnline.com using your new account number:  0496003095759

Online support is available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week by calling 1-800-XXXX and choosing option 3

I’ve attached a .pdf file that contains links to short training videos to help walk through many of the functional areas important in managing your account.

A couple of reminders:

a.Sign up for paperless billing to avoid a $10.00 per month fee


b.Must receive payment in full by the 22nd day after invoicing to avoid late fees


c.Default controls are set at 3 transactions per day per card and $150.00 per transaction.  Please click on “Change Default Controls” box below to see how you can customize or call customer service at 1-800-XXXX
