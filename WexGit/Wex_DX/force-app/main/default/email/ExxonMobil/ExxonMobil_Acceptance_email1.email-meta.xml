    <textOnly>One card is all you need- the ExxonMobil Universal Card.

Enjoy the convenience of nationwide acceptance at more than 90% of all retail fuel stations across the U.S., including more than 50,000 diesel sites, so your drivers will always be able to fuel up when and where they need to.*

&quot;I like the freedom of knowing that my drivers have access to fuel, no matter where they need to travel to complete their jobs.&quot; 
-Paul McGuire, General Superintendent, Farmer &amp; Irwin Corp. Mechanical Contractors
