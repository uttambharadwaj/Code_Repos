    <textOnly>ExxonMobil Fleet &amp; Universal Card Program

Control everything about your drivers&apos; card purchases with just a few clicks. A suite of control and alert tools allow you to know where, when, what and how much is being spent at any time.

&quot;The ExxonMobil Fleet program is a great management tool. I like the ability to go online and see everything my employees do at any time â€” what station they use, what time they fueled, the price per gallon, and odometer readings.&quot;
