Thank you for your time! I enjoyed the opportunity to speak with you about your business.  Through our conversation I was able to gain an understanding of what your pain points are in managing your fleet.  I know you will find that our ExxonMobil Fleet card is a great tool to help you save money and time.

Savings

Save 25 cents per gallon for 3 months,* then up to 6 cents per gallon**every time you fuel at any Exxon or Mobil locations.

Convenience &amp; Control

Accepted at more than10,000 Exxon- or Mobil-branded stations nationwide
Easy online controls so you can set spending limits and monitor driver behavior.

I will be following up with you next week. In the mean time, you can reach me at {!User.Phone} or via email at {!User.Email}.


I look forward to helping you meet the needs of your business.


Sincerely,
