Per my voice mail, I wanted to give you an overview of the ExxonMobil Fleet cards.  Our fleet cards options are the perfect tool to help you save time and money when it comes to you vehicle fleet operations.

Save money with valuable rebates
Manage your fuel use
Set purchase restrictions
Broad acceptance
Save time with online tools
Reduce unwanted spending

Whether you fuel a few or a fleet, ExxonMobil has the card that&apos;s right for your business.

I will follow up with you next week, as I am looking forward to meeting with you about the needs of your business.
