    <textOnly>Due to the Patriot Act, Credit is requesting “physical address verification”. I simply need a copy of a utility bill or some formal document listing your legal business name and the physical address you provided on the application. Once Credit receives this, they’ll be able to approve your account.


Thank you for your interest in the ExxonMobil Fleet card program.

Sincerely,
