Per my voice mail, I wanted to give you an overview of the ExxonMobil Fleet National card.   I know you will find that our card is the perfect tool to help you save money and time when it comes to your vehicle fleet operations.


Savings

Save 25 cents per gallon for 3 months,* then up to 6 cents per gallon** every time you fuel at any Exxon or Mobil locations.

Convenience &amp; Control

Accepted at more than 90% of all US retail fueling locations including more than 10,000 Exxon- or Mobil-branded stations nationwide.
Easy online controls so you can set spending limits and monitor driver behavior.

I will be following up with you next week. In the mean time, you can reach me at {!User.Phone} or via email at {!User.Email}.



I look forward to helping you meet the needs of your business.



Sincerely,
