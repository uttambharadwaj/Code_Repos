    <subject>Additional Information Required to Process Your Application</subject>
    <textOnly>Credit does need your signature on a Personal Guaranty prior to being able to process your application. Could you please print the attached Personal Guaranty, sign it, and fax it back to me at {!User.Fax}.


Also, due to the Patriot Act, Credit is requesting “physical address verification”. I simply need a copy of a utility bill or some formal document listing your legal business name and the physical address you provided on the application.


Thank you for your interest in the ExxonMobil Fleet card program.

Sincerely,
{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
