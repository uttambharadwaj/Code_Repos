    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

It has been a while since we last spoke, but I wanted to reconnect and see if your business situation has changed.

We have had a busy couple of months and I wanted to highlight a few particulars:

We save you money. Our programs give you the tools to restrict unauthorized purchases down to the card and/or product level

We save you time. Youâ€™ll enjoy the convenience of a single fueling card program and one, easy-to-read monthly invoice.

We give you the control. Detailed reports show how and where fueling money was spent, so you can account for every penny.

Wawa fleet is helping customers lower costs, increase efficiency, and get ahead. May I ask if you have moved forward with another industry solution? If another person would be more appropriate for this discussion, please refer me to him or her.

Best regards,
