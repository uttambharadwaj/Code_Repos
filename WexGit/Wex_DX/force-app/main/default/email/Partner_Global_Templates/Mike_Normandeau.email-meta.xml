    <textOnly>ear {!Contact.FirstName},

My name is {!User.Name} and I am with WEX, Inc, providers of the rapid!PayCard.

The rapid! PayCard provides companies nationwide with the most comprehensive PayCard benefit. An ePayroll program designed for employers choosing to eliminate, costly &amp; inefficient paper checks from their payroll process. This ZERO cost program was created for those employees currently not on direct deposit and who may not qualify for, or want, a bank account.

I wanted to take a moment to reach out to you to see if we can schedule a time to chat briefly on the phone sometime next week.  The purpose of the call would be to determine if our program might fulfill a need for {!Lead.Company}, and provide you with some additional information if warranted.

How does your calendar look for next week?  If a particular day and time works best for you, please let me know and I will work around your schedule.

I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.</textOnly>
