    <textOnly>Are you already fueling at our Murphy USA locations?

I&apos;d like to have an opportunity to discuss with you how Murphy USA is able to save businesses money in their overall fuel management.


We save you money. Potential to earn valuable rebates!
We save you time. Youâ€™ll enjoy the convenience of a single fueling card program and one, easy-to-read invoice. You can also easily download transaction data from the web right to QuickBooks or Excel each month.
We give you control. Detailed reports show how and where fueling money was spent, so you can account for every penny.
We make it convenient. Your drivers only need to carry one card to fuel at any participating location.

I&apos;ve included our program details attached. Please contact me should you have any questions.
