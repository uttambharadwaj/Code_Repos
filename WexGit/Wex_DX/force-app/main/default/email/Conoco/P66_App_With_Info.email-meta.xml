    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


I received your request for additional information on our Phillips 66 Fuel Card program. Please take a few minutes to look through the accompanying information. I’m confident that you’ll find the widely accepted WEX Fuel Card the one-card solution for all your fueling needs.

- We save you money.  Robust fuel rebates every time you fuel up
 at a Phillips 66, Conoco and 76 location. 

- We save you time. You’ll enjoy the convenience of a single fueling card program and one, easy-to-read invoice. You can also easily download transaction data from the web right to QuickBooks or Excel each month.

- We give you control. Detailed reports show how and where fueling money was spent, so you can account for every penny.

- We make it convenient. Your drivers only need to carry one card to fuel at any participating location.

You will find a complete list of accepting locations at http://www.phillips66gas.com/locations/.

It’s easy to enroll. Simply complete the attached application form and fax it back to me at {!User.Fax}.

Thank you for your interest in the Phillips 66 Fuel Card program.

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
