    <textOnly>Since your company is classified as a trucking company; our bank requires that your account be setup on Daily Direct Debit. With this plan, we simply debit your fleet program balance directly from your checking account daily for the previous dayâ€™s transactions.


Attached is the form to complete to get set up on Direct Debit.



Please take a few moments to fill this out and then fax it back to me at {!User.Fax}, along with a voided check.


If you have any questions please call me. Thank you for choosing the Phillips 66 Fuel Card program.
