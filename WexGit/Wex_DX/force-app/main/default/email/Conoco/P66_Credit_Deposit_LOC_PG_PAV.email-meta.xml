    <textOnly>You can obtain an account with Phillips 66 by either providing a deposit or completing a letter of credit with your bank. The amount you provide would become your credit limit. I am attaching the necessary paperwork for both the letter of credit and deposit.


For the letter of credit, one form needs to be signed by you and the other needs to be completed by your bank on their letterhead. Both must have original signatures. Then mail them back to Credit at:  7090 Union Park  Center, Suite 350, Midvale, UT 84047.


Or, if you choose to send a deposit, the last page must be completed. Please fax the agreement to me at {!User.Fax}, and mail a certified check to Credit at the above address.


If you prefer, you may submit a Personal Guaranty. An officer of the company must complete and sign the form, which can then be faxed back to me.


Also, as part of the approval process our bank is requesting to verify your physical address to comply with the Patriot Act.  We will need documentation from a third party to verify your business is located at the physical address listed on your application. The bank requires a copy of one of the following documents:

Utility bill or Insurance document  showing that the bill is mailed to the physical street address or that it services the physical address of the business
Lease agreement which identifies the business and the physical address of the office
Certified articles of Incorporation
An unexpired government-issues business license

Feel free to scan and email the verification to me or if you prefer, you can fax it directly to me at {!User.Fax}. Should you have any questions, I can be reached directly at {!User.Phone}.

Sincerely,
