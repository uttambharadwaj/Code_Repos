    <textOnly>Credit does need your signature on a Personal Guaranty prior to being able to process your application. Could you please print the attached Personal Guaranty?

Also, as part of the approval process our bank is requesting to verify your physical address to comply with the Patriot Act.  We will need documentation from a third party to verify your business is located at the physical address listed on your application. The bank requires a copy of one of the following documents:

Utility bill or Insurance document showing that the bill is mailed to the physical street address or that it services the physical address of the business
Lease agreement which identifies the business and the physical address of the office
Certified articles of Incorporation
An unexpired government-issues business license


Feel free to scan and email the verification along with the signed Personal Guaranty to me or if you prefer, you can fax it directly to me at {!User.Fax}.  Should you have any questions, I can be reached directly at {!User.Phone}.

Thank you for choosing Conoco!
