    <subject>Welcome to your new Fleet One Edge Account!</subject>
    <textOnly>{!OnlineApplication__c.Contact_Name__c},

Congratulations! Your Fleet One EDGE account has been created and your new account number is {!OnlineApplication__c.F1_Account_Number__c} . Your cards will be arriving shortly and will be ready to use (no need to call Customer Support to activate them!)

Please note, if you have opted to have ATM access, your 4-digit PIN number will be mailed to you in a separate envelope, and will arrive shortly before or after your new fuel cards. This PIN is for ATM use only and not to be confused with your Driver ID and/or Unit # which you will need to make fuel purchases.

Please keep the following information accessible at all times as it will not be mailed to you:

Online user info. You will need this information to manage your account online. Your Account number is your Online Login user id.
Supervisor/authorized contact security codes. You will need these codes whenever you call in to our 24 hour customer care. Your Employee # is &quot;1.&quot;

As a valued customer of Fleet One EDGE, we want to make it easy for you to maintain your account. That is why we have put all the necessary resources at your fingertips! Just go to Customer Links to find everything you need regarding your account, including tutorials that help make managing your account online a breeze.

Thank you,
