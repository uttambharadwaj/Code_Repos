Hey {!OnlineApplication__c.Contact_Name__c},

I appreciate you taking the time to learn more about our pre-funded program with Fleetone EDGE. Keep in mind the account is to be handled by the customer and that you will NOT be sent a billing statement. The customer is also responsible to make sure that funds are in the account before attempting to use the cards. When the available balance hits $0.00, the account will be temporarily deactivated until additional funds are added. 

Please login to your account online at https://manage.fleetone.com/security/fleetOneLogin to view your available balance and easily manage your account.  You will need your Carrier ID, password and PIN.  If you do not have this information please contact Customer Service at 800.359.7587.

In order to fund your account you may make payments either wire, ACH, or Western Union. Wire payments must be received by 4:00 PM MST in order for those funds to be available that day. ACH payments will not be applied to the account until the following business day. *IMPORTANT: WIRE PAYMENTS of less than $2,500.00 will be charged an inbound bank fee of $15.00.*  All Western Union payments will be charged a $20.00 fee regardless of the amount. When sending funds, please include your EFS account number as an addendum so that your funds may be more quickly applied to your account.  Below are the instruction for bank wires:

Bank Name:           Fifth Third Bank

Bank Account Number: 7361767473
Wire Routing Number: 042000314
ACH Routing Number: 064103833

Please note that Fifth Third uses different routing number for wires and ACH. If the incorrect routing number is used, the payment will be rejected by the bank.

Please make sure to include your Fleet One EDGE Carrier ID# in the payment remittance information (&quot;OBI Fields&quot;) - we cannot apply your payment without this information. Please follow the example illustrated below:

OBI Line 1: # 0006331703599


Wires are done through the Federal Reserve System and most banks do charge a fee for this.  Please ask your banker what fee they charge.

Here are the Western Union instructions:
