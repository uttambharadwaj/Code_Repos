    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in our Shell Fuel Card Program!

Unfortunately we weren&apos;t able to get your approved for an unsecured credit line, but we can still do a secured credit line with a deposit! The functionality is just the same, the credit line would just be backed by your deposit. You can choose however much you&apos;d like to send in as a deposit and that would turn into your monthly credit line. 

To enroll in an account with us, please send in a deposit to secure the account along with the attached Deposit form. You may either mail the deposit to our bank or wire us the funds.

Sending the deposit by mail:

Complete and sign the attached deposit agreement (the minimum deposit is $500)
Send the form to our bank (address below) with a certified check, money order or cashier’s check for the deposit amount you would like to put on deposit.
Reference opportunity # (insert number here) and mention the check is for a secured deposit in the memo section of the check.
Email a copy of the completed and signed deposit agreement to me at the email noted below

Bank Address:
WEX Bank
7090 Union Park Center, Suite 350
Midvale, UT 84047
