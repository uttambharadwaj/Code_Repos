    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The bank came back and requested additional info in the form of a deposit account, personal guarantee, or two years of financials from your bank. I know this isn&apos;t the ideal scenario, but any of the three options will get you pumping and saving on the fuel you are already using.

A deposit would be a minimum of $500 that becomes your self-funded line of credit towards your monthly fuel expenditure. Typically within 8-12 months of timely payments you can request to have credit re-review and offer a traditional line with a refund of your deposited amount. This is a great way to build business credit as we report to DNB and gives you all the rebates and advantages of a traditional account.

A PG would be a personal credit inquiry and tied to the business account. I understand everyone is in different places with future purchases on the horizon where this may not be an option, but an option nonetheless.

If you believe this result is incorrect and you can support your positive financial status please feel free to send me two full years of financials statements (profit/loss statement and balance sheet) to submit for re-review.

I&apos;ve attached the deposit form and personal guarantee form if you&apos;d like to go down either of those routes. Please send back to this email address. Feel free to call me at the number below if you have any questions.

Thank you for considering the Shell Fuel Card Program.


Sincerely,
