    <subject>Intro &amp; Resolution - {!Claim__c.Account_Name__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

Thank you for your letter regarding disputed transactions on fleet account ending {!Claim__c.Program_Account_Masked__c}.

Research and analysis by {!Claim__c.Partner_Formal_Name__c} Fraud Department produced the following information:

Disputed transactions occurred on card {!Claim__c.Abbreviated_Card__c} between {!Claim__c.Claim_Dispute_Start_Date__c} and {!Claim__c.Claim_Dispute_End_Date__c}. Pursuant to the contractual agreement governing use of the account, this is outside of the 60-Day allowable dispute period, therefore the claim has been closed.

If you currently do not have account Authorization Controls assigned to your cards, we strongly encourage you to do so.  For assistance with adding these controls, please contact Customer Service.

Regards,

Fleet Fraud Services
