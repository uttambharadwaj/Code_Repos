    <textOnly>Re: Dispute Claim No. {!Claim__c.Name}

Hello,

Thank you for your letter regarding disputed transactions on fleet account ending {!Claim__c.Program_Account_Masked__c}.

Research and analysis by WEX Fraud Department produced the following information:

Disputed transactions occurred on card {!Claim__c.Abbreviated_Card__c} between {!Claim__c.Allowable_Dispute_Start_Date__c} and {!Claim__c.Allowable_Dispute_End_Date__c}. Pursuant to the contractual agreement governing use of the account, this time frame is outside of the 60-Day allowable dispute period and the transactions are no longer eligible for dispute. Therefore the claim has been closed.

If you currently do not have account Authorization Controls assigned to your cards, we strongly encourage you to do so.  For assistance with adding these controls, please contact Customer Service.

Please feel free to contact us at Disputes@fleetfraudservices.com should you have any questions. We appreciate your business and look forward to maintaining our relationship.

Regards,

Fleet Fraud Services
