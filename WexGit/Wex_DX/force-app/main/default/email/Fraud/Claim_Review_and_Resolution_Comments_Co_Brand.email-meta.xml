CO-BRAND LIABLE COMMENTS:


Research and analysis by WEX Fraud Department produced the following information:

Include bullets that apply &amp; add any additional applicable details if needed.

No attempt to guess at DIN was made prior to the onset of the abuse.  This would indicate that the perpetrator had knowledge of the DIN or that the DIN was not kept in a confidential manner.
Transaction(s) totaling $ {!Claim__c.Ticket_Request_Amount__c} occurred inside a merchant location therefore a signature may have been obtained.  On the customer’s behalf WEX requested copies of the receipts, and once received WEX will forward the copies to {!Claim__c.Partner_Formal_Name__c}.
The remaining  / All disputed transactions were made at outside payment terminals (“OPT”).  No signature is required for OPT purchases as the swipe of the card into the card reader establishes that the card was present at the time of the sale.
There were no declined attempts to use the card after cancelling.  This would indicate that the perpetrator had knowledge the card was canceled or no longer had access to the card.
No further information to help identify or confirm the perpetrator(s) was available.</textOnly>
