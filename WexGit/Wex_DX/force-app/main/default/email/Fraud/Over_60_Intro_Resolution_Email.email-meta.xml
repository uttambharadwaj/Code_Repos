Re: Claim No {!Claim__c.Name}



Dear {!Claim__c.Account_Contact_Name__c}:



This letter confirms that we have reviewed your claim of disputed transactions on the {!Claim__c.Partner_Formal_Name__c} account for {!Claim__c.Account_Name__c}.  Firstly, the occurrence of fraud, misuse or abuse on our card program is extremely unfortunate and we are sensitive to the potential business and financial hardships it can cause to our customers.



Research and analysis by {!Claim__c.Partner_Formal_Name__c} Fraud Department produced the following information:


Disputed transactions occurred on card {!Claim__c.Abbreviated_Card__c} between {!Claim__c.Claim_Dispute_Start_Date__c} and {!Claim__c.Claim_Dispute_End_Date__c}. Pursuant to the contractual agreement governing use of the account, this is outside of the 60-Day allowable dispute period, therefore the claim has been closed.

{!Claim__c.Account_Name__c} has a commercial card account using the {!Claim__c.Partner_Formal_Name__c} Card Program with WEX Bank.   Use of your WEX fleet cards is governed at all times by the {!Claim__c.TC_s_Formal_Name__c} (the “Agreement”).  The Agreement addresses unauthorized use and associated responsibilities (refer to section 10).



In summary, pursuant to the terms of our Agreement and in conjunction with the reasons listed above, {!Claim__c.Account_Name__c} is liable for payment in full of the disputed transactions.  This constitutes final resolution to the dispute claim sufficiently identified above and does not apply to any other outstanding and/or future balances on the account.



To reduce the risk of similar circumstances occurring in the future, we recommend that you review the enclosed security measures document and immediately implement any measures conducive to your business.



Please feel free to contact us at (888) 691-0361 should you have any questions. We appreciate your business and look forward to maintaining our relationship.



Sincerely,

Fleet Fraud Services
