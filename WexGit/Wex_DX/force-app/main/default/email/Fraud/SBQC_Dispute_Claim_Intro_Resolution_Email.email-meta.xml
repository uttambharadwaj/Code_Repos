    <textOnly>Re: Claim No {!Claim__c.Name}



Dear {!Claim__c.Account_Contact_Name__c}:



Thank you for your letter regarding disputed transactions on fleet account ending {!Claim__c.Program_Account_Masked__c}.



This letter confirms that we have reviewed your claim of disputed transactions. The occurrence of fraud, misuse or abuse on our card program is extremely unfortunate and we are sensitive to the potential business and financial hardships it can cause to our customers.  Following are our findings and recommendations:


Disputed transactions occurred on card {!Claim__c.Abbreviated_Card__c}  between {!Claim__c.Allowable_Dispute_Start_Date__c} and {!Claim__c.Allowable_Dispute_End_Date__c} for approximately ${!Claim__c.Allowable_Dispute_Dollars__c}.
Disputed transactions were conducted using a valid Card(s) and Driver Identification Number(s).
The disputed transactions occurred at Outside Payment Terminals (OPT).  No signature is required for OPT purchases as the swipe of the card into the card reader establishes the card was present at the time of the sale.

{Claim__c.Account_Name__c} has a commercial card account using the {!Claim__c.Partner_Formal_Name__c} Card Program with WEX Bank.   Use of your {!Claim__c.Partner_Formal_Name__c} fleet cards is governed at all times by the {!Claim__c.TC_s_Formal_Name__c} (the “Agreement”).  The Agreement addresses unauthorized use and associated responsibilities (refer to section 10).



In summary, pursuant to the terms of our Agreement and in conjunction with the reasons listed above, {!Claim__c.Account_Name__c} is liable for payment in full of the disputed transactions.  This constitutes final resolution to the dispute claim sufficiently identified above and does not apply to any other outstanding and/or future balances on the account.



If you currently do not have account Authorization Controls assigned to your cards, we strongly encourage you to do so.  For assistance with adding these controls, please contact Customer Service.



To reduce the risk of similar circumstances occurring in the future, we recommend that you review the enclosed security measures document and immediately implement any measures conducive to your business.



Please feel free to contact us at Disputes@fleetfraudservices.com should you have any questions.  We appreciate your business and look forward to maintaining our relationship.



Sincerely,



Fleet Fraud Services
