I received your request for additional information on our WEX FlexCard revolving credit program. Please take a few minutes to look through the accompanying information. You’ll find our widely accepted WEX FlexCard is a one-card solution for all your fueling and vehicle servicing needs.

We save you money. 
Use your FlexCard at over 90% of fuel stations in the U.S. This allows you to access stations with the lowest price per gallon.

We save you time. 
Eliminate manually tracking receipts with the FlexCard detailed online reports and  add, update and suspend drivers quickly. You’ll enjoy the convenience of a single fueling card program and one, easy-to-read invoice.

We give you control. 
Take advantage of the real time transaction view and card authorization reports. You can also easily download this data from the web right to Excel each month.  Simply find out who, what, where and when the FlexCards were used by your drivers, so you can account for every penny.

We make it convenient. 
Your drivers only need to carry one card to fuel at any participating location. You will find a complete list of accepting locations at www.wexinc.com/accepting-locations, or download our mobile app at www.wexinc.com/wex-mobile/wex-connect which displays the fuel prices of accepting locations nearest you.
