    <textOnly>Dear{!Contact.FirstName}, 

I wanted to send one last email regarding the WEX Telematics program.   As we have not had a response from you on this,  I will assume that it is not a priority or something that you are not pursuing.  However, should your current position change, please reach out to us.

I look forward to hearing form you in the near future.
