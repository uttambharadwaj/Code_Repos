    <subject>Thank you for meeting about the Sunoco Fuel Management Program.</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you again for taking the time to meet with me regarding Sunoco&apos;s Fuel Management Program. If you have further questions about the information we reviewed together, please don&apos;t hesitate to contact me. I&apos;m here to provide you with whatever guidance you may need as you consider the Sunoco Program for your business.

It&apos;d be our sincerest pleasure to work with you toward more cost-effectively and efficiently managing and fueling your business vehicles. The Sunoco Fuel Management Program is a significantly powerful solution toward this goal. I hope you&apos;ll take advantage of the Program, including our initial savings of 20-cents off per gallon at any Sunoco for your first 60 days (our competitive rebate tiers apply thereafter).

I&apos;ve also attached a copy of our &quot;Level III Data&quot; white paper, which provides great insight into the data and controls behind the Sunoco Program -- and why they matter to businesses managing a fleet of vehicles.

Thanks again, {!Contact.FirstName}. I&apos;ll touch base soon to see if I may be of help in any way.

All the best,</textOnly>
