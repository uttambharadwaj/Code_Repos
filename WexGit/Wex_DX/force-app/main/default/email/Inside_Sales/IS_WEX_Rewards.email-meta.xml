    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Now that you’re a WEX Fuel Card customer, you can expand the value you receive by participating in our Rewards program*. Every time your drivers use your fuel cards, you’ll earn points that can be redeemed for valuable brand name rewards. Points add up quickly:

§ Fuel:  1 point per 2 gallons fueled

§ Service/Maintenance: 6 points per $1 spent

§ General Merchandise: 1 point per $1 spent


And redemption is easy, starting with as few as 700 points From travel to dining, shopping to entertainment, or cash back, you choose the rewards you want most.


I’m attaching further information about our Rewards program. You can also visit our website for additional information, at www.wrightexpressrewards.com.
