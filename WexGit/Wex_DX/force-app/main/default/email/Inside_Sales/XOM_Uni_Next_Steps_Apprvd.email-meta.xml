Now that the application has been approved, I wanted to take some time to prepare you for the next steps. We are now able to begin that cards set up. I will reach out to you and ask you the following questions regarding the preferences you have on how your cards are set up: 

How many cards are you going to need? (spare cards are generally recommended as a back up.  There is a replacement cost for future replacements.)
 
Do you want the cards to be fuel only or custom controls?
 
What company name do you want embossed on the card? (20 character limit)
 
Do you want anything on the second line of embossing? Ex: vehicle #, department, etc… This is optional
 
Do you have a list of drivers with driver ID’s or pin #’s or do you want me to generate random #’s you can change once you get the cards?

Please review these to have an understanding of the requirements we need in order to set up your cards so they function optimally with the online system.  Preparing questions about the information requested (or answers if you feel they are clear) will help us swiftly move through this process and make sure that cards function as intended and meet your specifications.    

As always, you are welcome to reach out to me If you have any questions. If you want to go ahead and submit responses to these requests, feel free to do so.  Otherwise, I look forward to following up with you later today.
