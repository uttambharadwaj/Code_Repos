    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Credit does need your signature on a Personal Guaranty prior to being able to process your application. Could you please print the attached Personal Guaranty, sign it, and fax it back to me at {!User.Fax}.

Also, due to the Patriot Act, Credit is requesting “physical address verification”. I simply need a copy of a utility bill or some formal document listing your legal business name and the physical address you provided on the application.


Thank you for your interest in the WEX program.
