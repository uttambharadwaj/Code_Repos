    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



I have received your vehicle and driver information forms. Your cards will be ordered today. You can expect to receive them within the next seven business days. Weâ€™ll send you two packages: one will contain your cards and the other will confirm your driver ID codes.


Cards are active when sent, so you may start fueling immediately upon receipt.


Now that you have an established account with us, you can easily make changes to your WEX account in three ways:


By Phone: Customer Services is available 7 days a week, 24 hours a
day at 1-800-492-0669

Online: You can make changes online anytime by visiting www.wexonline.com

Via Fax: I am attaching forms that you can use to make changes to your account. Simply fax them back to 1-800-395-0809


Welcome to the WEX Fuel Card program.






Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
