Thank you for your inquiry today.  Please note the information attached about the Fleet Card Program and the Universal Program, which are specifically designed for commercial use. Below I have highlighted key reasons why our business customers use our programs: 

Security:  Organizations can be confident that the fuel cards in the field cannot be used for anything but gas for their companyâ€™s fleet.  (Options for service and fluid transactions are available at the client&apos;s discretion). 
Convenience: Those businesses and organizations already using our program benefit from having a single fueling card program and one, easy-to-read monthly invoice. 
Control: Fleets enjoy being able to control when and how fuel is purchased by drivers through a web-based tool. There they can also view where, when, how much (gallon and dollar amounts) and who transacted so you can account for every penny.  

 If you have any questions feel free to contact me. If you want to go ahead with the program, follow this link to begin the application process or email or fax the completed application attached.  Otherwise, I will follow up in the next few days to get your thoughts and help with any questions.
