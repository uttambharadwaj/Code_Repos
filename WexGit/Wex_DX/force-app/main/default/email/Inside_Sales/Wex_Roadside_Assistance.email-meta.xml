    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 

We offer two Roadside Assistance programs.  Outlined below are the differences between the two programs.  The reason we have two is our first vendor only manages cars and light trucks.  Our second vendor handles all vehicle sizes.
 
·         Agero has pre-set pricing. You only pay for the services you use. Agero providers charge $72.00 for roadside assistance and $90.00 for towing within 10 miles. Any mileage over 10 miles is charged at the rate of $5 per mile. All passenger vehicles up to 2-ton trucks. (Agero Phone: 1-888-WEX-TOWS (1-888-939-8697)
·         NAC - you are charged whatever rate the individual tow companies charge. No pre-set pricing. To keep the NAC phone number handy, you can request card sleeve inserts with the dedicated phone number for Wex customers. (NAC Phone 1-866-329-3471)
 
I do have card sleeve inserts I can have sent to you for the NAC system.  Please refer to attachments for FAQs for each provider.
