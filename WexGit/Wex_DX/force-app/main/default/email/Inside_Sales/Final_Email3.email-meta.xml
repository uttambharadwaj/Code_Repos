{!Contact.FirstName},
I am sorry we were never able to reconnect. I will assume you currently have minimal to no interest in our program. Or, perhaps it is simply a bad time to make decisions of this nature.   However, I hope you will feel confident to reach out at anytime should you wish to consider this as a serious option for fuel management.   

Also, if you, in your business dealings and professional network, feel that this might be of benefit to others, you are welcome to pass on this information.  Below I have highlighted key reasons why our customers use our programs: 

Security:  Our customers can be confident that the fuel cards in the field cannot be used for anything but gas for their company’s fleet.  (Options for service and fluid transactions are available at the clients discretion). 
Convenience: Those businesses and organizations already using our program benefit from having a single fueling card program and one, easy-to-read monthly invoice. 
Control: Fleets enjoy being able to control when and how fuel is purchased by drivers through a web-based tool. There they can also view where, when, how much (gallon and dollar amounts) and who transacted so you can account for every penny.  

If you have any questions feel free to contact me any time. If you do decide to go ahead with the program, follow this link to begin the application process.  Otherwise, I’ll make this my last attempt to reach you. Thank you for your consideration of the WEX Fuel Card Program offered through ExxonMobile&apos;s Fleet Services Department
