    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Thank you for your interest in the WEX Small Business Gas Card program, designed to meet the unique needs of smaller businesses, helping them to make jobs easier and save money.  The card is easy to use; drivers simply enter an ID code at the point of sale, fuel and go.


The WEX Small Business Fuel Card program puts you in control over your fuel costs. You can choose to limit purchases on the card to fuel only. You can also set card controls to limit the total amount spent per day or per transaction. And concise reporting tells you who purchases what, when and where.


Itâ€™s easy to enroll. Simply complete the attached application form and fax it to me at {!User.Fax}.


Meanwhile, please give me a call with any questions.




Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
