    <textOnly>{!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.LastName}, 
 
I have been in contact with MAIN CONTACT NAME HERE and they determined you would be the person I should meet with to review how your company manages your payables process to see if my company can reduce your costs or help you gain more control over your expenses.
 
We help organizations like {!Account.Name} with streamlining your payables system. We are not looking to replace your treasury bank relationship, but to simply see if there are areas we can assist you with a custom built payment solution that costs you nothing.
 
Specifically what we do is:
 
  - Give you insight - track and manage business travel and entertainment expenses with real-time visibility and online ease. 
  - Give you control – instant single use ghost card technology allows you to instantly pay vendors for the exact agreed upon amount.
  - Give you efficiencies - advanced &quot;epayables&quot; technology automates your vendor payments and simplifies your reconciliation without changing your AP process or software.
  - Give you savings – control who can spend, how much and where with our intuitive web based account control dashboard.
 
Attached are testimonials from a few of our customers that show:
 
  - Wright Express provides the most flexible program in the industry.
  - Wright Express Customer Service is unparalleled in the industry.
  - Wright Express customers realize significant cost savings.
 
I don’t know if we could duplicate these kinds of results with your company, but wouldn’t it be interesting to find out?
 
I look forward to speaking meeting with you.

Sincerely,
