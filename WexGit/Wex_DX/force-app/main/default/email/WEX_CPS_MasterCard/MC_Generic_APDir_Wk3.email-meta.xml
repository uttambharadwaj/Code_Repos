Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.LastName},

I am following up on last week’s message introducing WEX Virtual payments solution for your Accounts Payable department.  It is a no cost solution that delivers money to your bottom line and vendor participation is critical.

Regarding Vendor Participation:

WEX will take the lead enrolling vendors on your behalf—a service you’re not likely to get from an ACH vendor
We will collaborate with you to develop an enrollment strategy appropriate to your supplier relationships
Key suppliers in your sector are already enrolled and accepting this method of electronic payment

With WEX, you can expect practical advice and consultation so that you get the most out of this new program.  It’s born out of a service philosophy you cannot find in a traditional bank.  Just ask any one of our 300,000 commercial payments customers we have served (and continue to serve) over 30 years.

I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you for an initial discovery session.  I will call you in the next few days to see about availability.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.

Sincerely,
{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
