    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for joining the recent University Business webinar -- &quot;Practical ePayment Applications on Campus&quot; -- sponsored by Wright Express. Hopefully you found the information valuable, and understand the dynamics leading to increased adoption of ePayment programs by both buyers and suppliers.

Wright Express’ ePayments solution – AP Direct – is a no-cost, bank to bank transfer of funds that delivers money to your bottom line. Even better—it integrates directly into your existing ERP system.

Key Benefits:

* Maximize financial incentives—think cash back—while paying your bills electronically
* Improve working capital—pay your vendors faster and pay us later
* Reduce cycle time and costs associated with paper checks
* Improve your team’s efficiency with automated reconciliations

Wright Express is the only commercially chartered bank fully dedicated to addressing your business to business payment needs.   As such, you can expect continued investment in solutions, consultations and services to meet your needs.

I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss any questions you may have about AP Direct, or Wright Express. Would next week work for you? In addition, I have attached some additional materials for your review. Finally, feel free to review an archive of this recent webinar at: http://www.universitybusiness.com/webseminar/practical-applications-e-payments-campus  .
