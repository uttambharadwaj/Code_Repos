    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for joining the recent tnooz.com webinar -- &quot;Practical ePayment Applications for Travel Booking&quot; -- sponsored by Wright Express. Hopefully you found the information valuable.

Wright Express’ ePayments solution – Purchase Log – is single-use account technology perfected for booking travel reservations. Reduce overcharges in hotel booking payments, and drive efficiencies with automated reconciliations. Even better—Purchase Log integrates directly into your existing systems.

I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss any questions you may have about Purchase Log, or Wright Express. Would next week work for you? In addition, I have attached some additional materials for your review. Finally, feel free to review an archive of this recent webinar here: http://www.tnooz.com/2012/02/23/event/webinar-event/tnooz-wright-express-webinar-video-practical-epayment-applications-for-travel-booking/.
