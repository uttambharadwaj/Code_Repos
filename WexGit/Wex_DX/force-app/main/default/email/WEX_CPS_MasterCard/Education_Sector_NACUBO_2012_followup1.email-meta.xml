Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for visiting the Wright Express booth at the 2012 NACUBO annual meeting in National Harbor, MD. Wright Express offers a suite of payment solutions to meet your campus&apos; unique needs. We are committed to identifying cost-savings effeciencies and are focused on delivering &apos;best-in-class&apos; solutions. We&apos;ll take on the projects your traditional bank won&apos;t touch.

Why choose Wright Express?

There are two important points of differentiation between Wright Express and traditional banks. 

·    Our B2B focused industrial bank allows us to concentrate on specialized solutions that cater to the unique needs of businesses and institutions, as opposed to other banks that have a split focus on consumers and businesses.

·    We focus exclusively on corporate payment solutions and do not offer deposit accounts or treasury services. This specialized focus gives us the opportunity to devote our resources to best-in-class solutions whereas our competitors tend to cross- or up-sell payment solutions as an add-on to treasury services.

I&apos;d like to share with you a benchmark report on ePayments within higher education and a case study of an ePayment implementation that had a positive impact on a campus&apos; internal effeciencies and provided an additional source of revenue. This no-cost solution simply interfaced with the campus&apos; existing ERP system for vendor payments.

I will follow up with a phone call to see about scheduling an initial discovery session. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.

Sincerely,
