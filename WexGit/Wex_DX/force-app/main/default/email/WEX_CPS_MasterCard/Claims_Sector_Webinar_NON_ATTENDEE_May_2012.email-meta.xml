    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.LastName},

We are sorry that you were not able to join the recent webinar with Claims magazine -- &quot;Paying Claims Electronically: Lessons from the Field&quot; -- sponsored by Wright Express. Jim Pratt from Wright Express was joined by David Baker from Mercury Select Management Company, Inc., a division of Mercury Insurance Group. The presenters reviewed recent trends in ePayments, provided an overview of  single-use virtual accounts for claims payments, and shared results and best practices.  For your convenience, a recording of the webinar is available by clicking here. 

Wright Express (NYSE: WXS) is the only commercially chartered bank fully dedicated to addressing your business to business payment needs. Recently, Forbes ranked Wright Express on its list of America&apos;s 100 Best Small Companies for the fourth consecutive year. As such, you can expect continued investment in solutions, consultations and services to meet your needs.

For our current customers, we have integrated our single-use ‘virtual’ account technology with their claim system to apply a ‘unique’ 16-digit MasterCard account number to each claim payment. The unique account number is automatically faxed to the vendor to pay for the repair (service contract cost) with the credit limit set at the exact dollar amount due to prevent fraud or overcharging. The account number is then discarded by Wright Express and never again used after the payment has posted. This payment process helps these companies immensely in terms of reconciliation within their claim system, speed of paying their vendors and most importantly—it can generate significant rebate dollars back to their companies.

I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss any questions you may have about single-use accounts or Wright Express. Would next week work for you? In addition, I have attached some additional materials for your review.

Sincerely,
