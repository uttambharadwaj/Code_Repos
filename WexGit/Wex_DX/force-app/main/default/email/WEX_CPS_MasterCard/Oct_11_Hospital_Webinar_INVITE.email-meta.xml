    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Healthcare Finance News and Wright Express will host a discussion exploring recent developments in the ePayables industry.  You will learn how hospitals and health care providers can use ePayments to improve efficiencies and generate a revenue stream while paying their bills. The webinar is set for 2 p.m. EDT, Tuesday, October 25th.

During this session, you will hear tips—and potential traps to avoid—when evaluating the spectrum of electronic payable solutions.  Panelists will share first-hand accounts of recent market trends in Healthcare A/P automation and strategies for partnering with vendors for mutual benefit in the payments process.  In addition, you will be able to identify the advantages and disadvantages of ePayment methods and learn specific strategies for evaluating ePayment opportunities and providers.

Panelists include:
- Henry Ijams, Managing Director, Paystream Advisors
- Jim Pratt, Vice President, Wright Express

The event is presented by Wright Express. You can register at: http://www.bulldogsolutions.net/MedTech/MED1108/frmRegistration.aspx?bdls=29567.  I hope you are able to join this session.
