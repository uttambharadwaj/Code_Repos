    <textOnly>Free Webinar: Practical ePayment Applications for Travel Booking
 
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
Are you a CFO, financial controller, director of operations or an accounting manager for an online travel agency, traditional agency, or tour operator booking travel for clients?
 
Then ask yourself these questions:

-- Are high volumes of supplier booking payments creating an accounting nightmare for your payments teams? 
-- Are you sacrificing control, or having difficulty managing to contracted rates with your supplier base? 
-- Do you spend too much time resolving payment disputes?

If so, our panel of payments experts in travel booking will help you tackle this problem in a different way.
 
In this webinar, payment experts from Wright Express, Expedia and HotelTonight will discuss how single-use virtual accounts can help drive efficiencies in the payment and settlement process for OTAs, traditional agencies and tour operators.
 
You will hear tips – and potential traps to avoid – when evaluating the landscape of electronic payment solutions for travel booking.
 
The webinar is scheduled for February 23rd, 11am US EST/4pm UK.  You can register here: https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/677676806 .
 
Our webinar panelists are:

-- Jim Pratt, Wright Express, VP, Corporate Payment Solutions 
-- Chris Richter, Expedia, Senior Project Manager, Financial Operations 
-- Jared Simon, HotelTonight, Chief Operating Officer 
-- Marc DeVallette, Wright Express, Product Manager

I hope you can join what is sure to be an informative session.

Sincerely,
