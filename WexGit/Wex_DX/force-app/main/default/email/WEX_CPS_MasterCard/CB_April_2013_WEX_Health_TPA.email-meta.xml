    <subject>Virtual Payments in Healthcare Driving Cost Savings</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;


The migration to electronic payments is rapidly building momentum as the Healthcare industry reacts to the Affordable Care Act.  Research indicates that 80-90% of payment transactions are historically made by paper check.  A significant transformation is under way.


WEX Bank is a leading provider of commercial payment processing. WEX Virtual offers a paperless alternative to reimburse providers that is faster and more efficient than check, and offers more data capabilities than ACH. We pioneered this payment technology in 2000 and processed over $31 billion in commercial payments in 2012.


WEX Virtual can help you realize these key benefits:

· Streamline and automate payments and reconciliations

· Earn revenue share on payments

· Lower operational costs, averaging a minimum of $10 reduction per transaction

· No-cost, straightforward integration with existing systems

· Virtually eliminate fraud risk via transaction specific, one-to-one payment process

· Increase payment visibility and insight, through extensive invoice-level data capture and robust reporting features



I’ve attached a brochure which highlights some of the program features.  Ideally, I’d appreciate the chance to meet with you and your colleagues to discuss the program and how it can help {!Account.Name} continue to excel in your field of processing and paying claims.  My contact information can be found below, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
