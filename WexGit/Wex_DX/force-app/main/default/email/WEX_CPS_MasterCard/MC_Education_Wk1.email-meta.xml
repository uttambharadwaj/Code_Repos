    <textOnly>Start Turning Payments into Profits

Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I would like 30 minutes to introduce you to the easiest new revenue 
opportunity that you could start collecting this quarter.  Wright 
Express’ ePayments solution – AP Direct – provides your Accounts 
Payable department with a new payment option that replaces checks.  It’s
 a no-cost, ACH-like solution that delivers money to your bottom line.  
Even better—it integrates directly into your existing ERP system. 

Key Benefits:
- Maximize financial incentives—think cash back—while paying your bills electronically
- Improve working capital—pay your vendors faster and pay us later
- Reduce cycle time and costs associated with paper checks
- Improve your team’s efficiency with automated reconciliations

Wright Express is the only commercially chartered bank fully dedicated to 
addressing your business to business payment needs.   As such, you can 
expect continued investment in solutions, consultations and services to 
meet your needs.  Don’t let this revenue opportunity pass you by. 

I will follow up with a phone call to see about scheduling an initial 
discovery session.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact 
me with questions.

Sincerely, 
{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
