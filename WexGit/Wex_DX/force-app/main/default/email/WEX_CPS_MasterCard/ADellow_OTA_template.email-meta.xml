    <subject>Wright Express Payment Solutions Introduction</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to send you a brief introduction to Wright Express prior to calling you.

We are B2B payments specialist and a leading provider of single use virtual card technology to the online travel industry.  We provide the solution that powers the supplier payment process for many of the world’s top online travel agents.  

Key benefits of our solution include – Control, Information and Automation.

* Control: Ensure that payments can only be made for the right amount, at the right time, to the right supplier. 
* Information: Capture bespoke data specific to booking e.g. hotel name, reservation number, cost centre to ensure that all payments reconcile to each order.
* Automation: By integrating our solution into your booking / reservation system through industry standard web services, each payment transaction can be fully automated and the reconciliation process can be completed without manual intervention.

I will give you a call in the next day or so to discuss further but should you wish to contact me in the meantime please do not hesitate to do so.

Kind regards,
