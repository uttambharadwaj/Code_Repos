    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},
 
Thank you for your interest in the Wright Express Corporate MasterCard.
 
We have quietly become one of the leading commercial card issuers in the U.S. through our fleet fuel card and MasterCard programs. We can offer you a standard &quot;travel and entertainment&quot; card, a corporate purchasing card or a virtual card program which can streamline your A/P process or potentially eliminate a typical purchase order system.
 
If you have any questions, please call me at {!User.Phone}. I will follow up with you in the coming days to see what Wright Express can do to help build a corporate payment program that is easy for your employees to use while taking costs out of your business through service and reporting that is unmatched in the industry.
 
Sincerely,
