    <subject>Webinar: Lessons from Two Successful Virtual Payment Programs</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I thought you might be interested in the online webinar described below hosted by the Institute of Financial Operations, and featuring two Wright Express clients.

On April 24th, 11:30 EST, Jim Pratt from Wright Express, Lorraine Creek from Cambia Health Solutions, and David Sumners from Travelliance will discuss recent trends in virtual payment programs, and key success factors when considering for your organization.  Areas covered will include how virtual payment programs have improved payment processes in their financial operations, and ways to control indirect spend beyond traditional plastic cards.  The panel will also cover why virtual payment programs are seeing significant increases in usage as a broader understanding of their role &amp; acceptance by vendors has emerged in the last two years.
