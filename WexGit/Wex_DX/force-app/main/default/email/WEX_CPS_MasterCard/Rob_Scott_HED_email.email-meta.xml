    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Interested in turning {!Account.Name}&apos;s A/P payments into a revenue source? You&apos;re not alone. One out of every two colleges and universities is considering implementing a virtual payment strategy to reap the financial rewards and streamline payment operations.

There is a significant opportunity to drive down internal costs and increase operational efficiencies by reducing the use of paper checks.  With virtual payments the onerous task of 1099 reporting is reduced and can provide a generous rebate program so that you can generate revenue from your payables.  There are no fees to you of any kind.

WEX is a virtual payments pioneer and our sole focus providing best-in-class payment solutions to our customers.  Please let me know if you or a member of your team will be available to discuss further.  In the meantime, you can learn more about WEX Virtual Payments by visiting our Resource Center.

Thank you and regards,
