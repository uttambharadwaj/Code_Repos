Attending the P&amp;A Leadership Summit in Las Vegas? Stop by the WEX Bank booth (#509) and enter to win an iPad. While you are there, weâ€™d love to chat with you about how WEX Insurance can make a significant impact on your business.

Please stop by and introduce yourself.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.
