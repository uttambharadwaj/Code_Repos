    <textOnly>Suite of Best-in-Class Payment Programs

{!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.LastName},

I am writing to introduce myself and ask for 30 minutes on your calendar to discuss new electronic payment options for both accounts payable and purchasing transactions for {!Account.Name}.

I’d like to talk with {!Account.Name} about how your accounting and procurement areas could benefit with these programs.  In addition to improve operational efficiencies, {!Account.Name} could realize a new source of revenue as rebates are available based on annual transactional volume and billing/repayment terms.

For over 28 years, Wright Express Corporation (NYSE: WXS) has been one of the premier commercial payment providers in the U.S. with a suite of &apos;best-in-class’ ePayables solutions.  For the 4th consecutive year Forbes has ranked Wright Express in its list of America&apos;s 100 Best Small Companies; Wright Express was ranked 30th in 2011.

I will be following up in the next couple of days to see if we can schedule an initial introduction meeting.  In the meantime, please feel free to contact me as well via email or phone.

Sincerely, 
{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
