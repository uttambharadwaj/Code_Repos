With the Wright Express Universal Fleet Card you can set pre-determined limits on what drivers can charge, how often and on what kinds of products and services, during what period of time.  Gain ultimate control over vehicle related spending.
 
The program’s powerful reporting functions also help you slash the administrative time and expense involved in tracking and managing vehicle related spending.
