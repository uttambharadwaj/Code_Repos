WEX Virtual Integrates Easily into your Existing Systems and Processes&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;


Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I am following up on last week’s message introducing WEX Virtual payments solution for your Accounts Payable department.  As I had outlined, our no-cost solution delivers financial benefits that are real and immediate. Here’s how it works:


Your vendors enroll as participating vendors—We lead the charge in enrolling them
You manage and approve invoices from your vendors in your existing ERP system as you do today
Vendors are flagged as participating vendors in your system
Upon approval, payments to flagged vendors are automatically included in an electronic file transfer to our system, and payment can be automatically pushed to your vendors


If your system supports check file runs today, chances are it supports an electronic file run to our system.  Our solution integrates with over 150 existing ERP systems and counting.

With continued financial pressures, you cannot afford to pass up this opportunity within your payments department—it’s like cash back for payments you already make.  I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you for an initial discovery session.  I will call you in the next few days to see about availability.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.

Sincerely,
{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
