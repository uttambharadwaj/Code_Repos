    <subject>Sorry We Missed You: ePayments for Travel Booking Webinar</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Recently, Wright Express sponsored a webinar through tnooz.com &quot;Practical ePayment Applications for Travel Booking.&quot;  Jim Pratt from Wright Express was joined by two presenters from Expedia and HotelTonight, two Wright Express clients. Presenters reviewed recent trends in ePayments, provided an overview of  single-use ghost accounts for hotel bookings, and shared results and best practices.  For your convenience, a recording of the webinar is available at the link below.

Wright Express’ ePayments solution – Purchase Log – is single-use account technology perfected for booking travel reservations. Reduce overcharges in hotel booking payments, and drive efficiencies with automated reconciliations. Even better—Purchase Log integrates directly into your existing systems.

I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss any questions you may have about Purchase Log, or Wright Express. Would next week work for you? In addition, I have attached some additional materials for your review. 

Again, feel free to review an archive of this recent webinar by clicking here: http://www.tnooz.com/2012/02/23/event/webinar-event/tnooz-wright-express-webinar-video-practical-epayment-applications-for-travel-booking/
