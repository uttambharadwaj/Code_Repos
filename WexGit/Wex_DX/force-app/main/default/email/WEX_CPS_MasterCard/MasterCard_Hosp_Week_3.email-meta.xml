    <subject>Wright Express ePayments Widely Accepted</subject>
    <textOnly>New Payment Method Already Accepted by 10,000+ Hospital Vendors

Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I am following up on last week’s message introducing Wright Express’ ePayments solution for your Accounts Payable department.  AP Direct is a no cost solution that delivers money to your bottom line.  And, vendor participation is critical.

Regarding Vendor Participation:

    * Wright Express will take the lead enrolling vendors on your behalf—a service you’re not likely to get from an ACH vendor
    * We will collaborate with you to develop an enrollment strategy appropriate to your supplier relationships
    * Over 10,000 regular suppliers to hospitals are already enrolled and accepting this method of electronic payment—including large vendors like Stryker, Stericycle, Cardinal, Medtronic

With Wright Express, you can expect practical advice and consultation so that you get the most out of this new program.  It’s born out of a service philosophy you cannot find in a traditional bank.  Just ask any one of our 300,000 commercial payments customers we have served (and continue to serve) over 27 years.

I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you for an initial discovery session.  I will call you in the next few days to see about availability.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.

Sincerely,
