    <subject>Upcoming University Business Webinar on ePayments</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

You may have heard about the emergence of ePayment solutions across America&apos;s college and university business offices.  These solutions help replace inefficient paper check payments to your vendors, and pay you cash rebates to do so.  In fact, your school district could benefit in a similar way.

University Business and Wright Express will host a discussion exploring recent developments in the ePayables industry. You will learn how colleges and universities can use ePayments to improve efficiencies and generate a revenue stream while paying their bills. The webinar is set for 2 p.m. EDT, Thursday, October 27th. 
 
During this session, you will hear tips—and potential traps to avoid—when evaluating the spectrum of electronic payable solutions. Panelists will share first-hand accounts of recent market trends in higher education A/P automation and strategies for partnering with vendors for mutual benefit in the payments process. In addition, you will be able to identify the advantages and disadvantages of ePayment methods and learn specific strategies for evaluating ePayment opportunities and providers.

Panelists include:
Henry Ijams, Managing Director, PayStream Advisors 
Jim Pratt, Vice President, Wright Express 
Diane Parker, Assistant Vice President for Finance, Lasell College

The event is presented by Wright Express. You can register at:
