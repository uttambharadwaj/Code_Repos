    <textOnly>AP Direct Integrates Easily into your Existing Systems and Processes

Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I am following up on last week’s message introducing Wright Express’ 
ePayments solution for your Accounts Payable department.  As I had 
outlined, our no-cost solution delivers financial benefits that are real
 and immediate. 

Here’s how it works:
- Wright Express AP Direct:Your vendors enroll as participating vendors—We lead the charge in enrolling them
- You manage and approve invoices from your vendors in your existing ERP system as you do today
- Vendors are flagged as participating vendors in your system
- Upon approval, payments to flagged vendors are automatically included in an electronic file transfer to our system, and payment can be automatically
 pushed to your vendors

If your system supports check file runs today, chances are it supports an 
electronic file run to our system.  Our solution integrates with over 
150 existing ERP systems and counting.

With continued financial pressures, you cannot afford to pass up this 
opportunity within your payments department—it’s like cash back for 
payments you already make.  I would appreciate an opportunity to meet 
with you for an initial discovery session.  

I will call you in the next few days to see about availability.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.

Sincerely, 
{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
