    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName}, 

I am wondering if you could give me some advice. We help organizations like {!Account.Name} with streamlining your payables system and possibly turning bill payment and purchase order processing into a revenue generator.  I don’t know whom I need to speak with to see if we can help you in this area. 

This is where I need some help from you.  Who would be the individual within your organization (if not you) that you would recommend I meet with to look at our services to see if there’s a potential fit?
 
Specifically what we do is:
 
  - Give you insight - track and manage business travel and entertainment expenses with real-time visibility and online ease. 
  - Give you control – instant single use ghost card technology allows you to instantly pay vendors for the exact agreed upon amount.
  - Give you efficiencies - advanced &quot;epayables&quot; technology automates your vendor payments and simplifies your reconciliation without changing your AP process or software.
  - Give you savings – control who can spend, how much and where with our intuitive web based account control dashboard.
 
Attached are testimonials from a few of our customers that show:
 
  - Wright Express provides the most flexible program in the industry.
  - Wright Express Customer Service is unparalleled in the industry.
  - Wright Express customers realize significant cost savings.
 
I don’t know if we could duplicate these kinds of results with your company, but wouldn’t it be interesting to find out?
 
I look forward to speaking with you. And, thank you for any advice you can give me.

Sincerely,
