    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Interested in turning A/P payments into a revenue source? You&apos;re not alone. One out of every two colleges and universities are considering implementing an ePayable strategy to reap the financial rewards and streamline payment operations.

University Business and Wright Express will host a discussion exploring recent developments in ePayments in Higher Education. Panelists will cover recent trends and best practices from successful implementations, and working with vendors to prepare for the change.  You will learn how colleges and universities can use ePayments to improve efficiencies and generate a revenue stream while paying their bills. The webinar is set for 2 p.m. EDT, Tuesday, April 3rd.

Panelists include:

- Jim Pratt, Vice President, Wright Express
