    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;


Thank you for stopping by the WEX booth and I hope you enjoyed the NAPCP Conference in New Orleans. I wanted to reach out to you regarding electronic payment options for both accounts payable and purchasing transactions for {!Account.Name}. In addition to improving operational efficiencies, {!Account.Name} could realize a new source of revenue as rebates are available based on annual transactional volume and billing/repayment terms.


The virtual payment programs offered by WEX can be implemented with no out-of-pocket cost, and interface directly with your existing systems and payment processes.


Key Benefits:

Improve payment controls
Maximize financial incentives—think cash back—while paying your bills electronically
Improve working capital—pay your vendors faster and pay us later
Improve your team’s efficiency with automated reconciliations

WEX is the only commercially chartered bank fully dedicated to addressing your business to business payment needs. As such, you can expect continued investment in solutions, consultations and services to meet your needs.


For 30 years, WEX (NYSE: WEX) has been one of the premier commercial payment providers in the U.S. with a suite of &apos;best-in-class’ ePayables solutions.  For the 5th consecutive year Forbes has ranked us in its list of America&apos;s 100 Best Small Companies.


I will be following up in the next couple of days to see if we can schedule an initial introduction meeting.  In the meantime, please feel free to contact me as well via email or phone.


Sincerely,
