    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Recently, Wright Express sponsored a webinar through IAPP entitled &quot; Lessons from Two Practical Virtual Payment Programs.&quot; Presenters reviewed recent trends in virtual payment programs, described the dynamics leading to increased adoption of ePayment programs by both buyers and suppliers, and offered some best practices for organizations considering ePayable solutions. For your convenience, a recording of the webinar is available at: https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/550985793 .

Wright Express’ virtual payment programs can be implemented with no out-of-pocket cost, and interface directly with your existing systems and payment processes.

Key Benefits:

- Improve payment controls
- Maximize financial incentives—think cash back—while paying your bills electronically
- Improve working capital—pay your vendors faster and pay us later
- Improve your team’s efficiency with automated reconciliations

Wright Express is the only commercially chartered bank fully dedicated to addressing your business to business payment needs. As such, you can expect continued investment in solutions, consultations and services to meet your needs.

I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss any questions you may have about AP Direct or Wright Express. Would next week work for you? 

Sincerely,
