    <textOnly>Dear &lt;insert name&gt;,

Before we can process your application, we just need some more information from you. 
To support the credit limit you have requested in your application for a WEX Motorpass Fuel Card account, we need a copy of your most recent balance sheets and profit and loss statements for the past two years, plus any additional supporting notes.

We need this information to assess your WEX Motorpass application against our credit policy.

I’m always here to help.
If you have any questions at all, please feel free to call me via my details below.

Yours sincerely,</textOnly>
