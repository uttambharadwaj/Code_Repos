They Just Get Better and Better


{!Contact.FirstName},

Did you know that as a TruckersB2B member, you receive exclusive access to multiple benefits at TA/Petro?  For starters, just by stopping at one of their 244 locations, you can save $.10 a gallon! You don&apos;t have to worry about minimum fueling requirements, and the point of sale discount is automatically reflected on your billing card invoice. It&apos;s that simple. There is nothing new you need to do.

While you&apos;re already there fueling up, you can also take advantage of the PM and DOT savings at TA/Petro. You can save up to $15 on PM services and $5 on DOT inspections. The discount is based on your DOT number, so make sure your profile is always up to date at truckersb2b.com/myprofile.

Don&apos;t forget about the breakdown benefits with RoadSquad Connect. As a member, you receive a $15 discount on labor for all road calls completed by a TA/Petro RoadSquad service truck.

To learn more about your TA/Petro benefits, visit us online at truckersb2b.com or call 866.354.7322.</textOnly>
