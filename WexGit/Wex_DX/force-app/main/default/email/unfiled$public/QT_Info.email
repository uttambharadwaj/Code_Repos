Hello,<br />
<br />
Your Quiktrip Account&nbsp;was&nbsp;converted into a new internal operating system which required a new account number and cards.&nbsp; Your new cards have a new account number and a new web address. You will want to enroll as a new user with the new account number at www.qtfleetmaster.com As you start using the new cards and the old account is not being used any longer it will be shut down. The website is laid out differently but still have the same functionality of the old site. Please make sure to log onto your old site at http://www.fleetservicesonline.com to make sure the final payment is made. &nbsp;If you have any questions or concerns please give us a call at any time.<br clear="none" />
