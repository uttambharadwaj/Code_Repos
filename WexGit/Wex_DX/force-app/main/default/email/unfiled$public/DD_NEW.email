Hello Robbie,<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting us. In order to set this account up for direct debit you will need to close it and open a new one with a different billing cycle. The sales department can assist you with this and they can be reached at 1-800-637-7037.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can make payments online or over the phone each month for free for your convenience.&nbsp;<br />
