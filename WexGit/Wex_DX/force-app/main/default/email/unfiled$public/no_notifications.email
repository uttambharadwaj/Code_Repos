Thank you for contacting us. I am sorry to hear that the notifications are not being received. I will have this looked into on our end. In the meantime you could mark the calendar or use an online reminder that you need to log in and pull the invoice. &nbsp;We do offer free pay by phone or online with same day processing if made before 3:30 pm EST. &nbsp;If you need to revert to paper billing we can adjust that for you as well. Please advise if you need further assistance.
