Dear {!Lead.FirstName},



I’d like to introduce myself. I am a [role] at WEX, a company specialising in providing payment solutions to businesses throughout the world.



If your business currently uses a standard credit card to manage your vehicle fleet expenses then we may have an opportunity for you. With fuel prices representing a significant variable cost to your business it’s important to take control where you can.



We could help you find significant operating efficiencies, save money and have greater control and insight into this area of your business, allowing you to make informed business decisions.

If you would be interested in a short telephone conversation, please reply and let me know a time that is convenient to you and I can get this organised for us.



In the meantime, if you would be interested in a short article on the benefits our opportunity could provide versus your current payment methods please click here to access.



Kind regards,
