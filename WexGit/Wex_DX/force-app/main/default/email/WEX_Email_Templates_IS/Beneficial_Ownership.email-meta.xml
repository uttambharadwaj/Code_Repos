    <textOnly>Before we can review your application, we must ask you to identify:

Any person who owns, directly or indirectly, at least 25 percent of the equity interests of this business.
One person with a significant managing role, like an executive officer or senior manager.

Federal regulations now require all banks to verify the ownership of certain business types when they open a new account.

Please provide the Name, Address, Date of Birth, and Social Security Number (or Passport Number, in the case of foreign persons) for each individual.

We’ve made it easy.

Simply complete this form, sign it.  You can either scan it and email or fax it back to me.

Read our FAQ about this Federal requirement here.  If you still have questions, don’t hesitate to call us at 1-800-395-0812 ext 3.
