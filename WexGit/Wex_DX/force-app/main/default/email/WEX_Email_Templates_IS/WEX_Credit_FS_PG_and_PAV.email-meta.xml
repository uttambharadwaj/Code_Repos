    <textOnly>In order to qualify for credit, you may either submit financial statements for your business or have an officer of the company sign a Personal Guarantee.


If you choose to send financial statements, I will need one full year of financial records. This consists of your balance sheet and income statement.


Also, As part of the approval process our bank is requesting to verify your physical address to comply with the Patriot Act.  We will need documentation from a third party to verify your business is located at the physical address listed on your application. The bank requires a copy of one of the following documents:


Utility bill or Insurance document  showing that the bill is mailed to the physical street address or that it services the physical address of the business
Lease agreement which identifies the business and the physical address of the office
Certified articles of Incorporation
An unexpired government-issues business license


Feel free to scan and email the verification to me or if you prefer, you can fax it directly to me at {!User.Fax}.



Should you have any questions, I can be reached directly at {!User.Phone}.



Thank you for your interest in the WEX program.

Sincerely,
