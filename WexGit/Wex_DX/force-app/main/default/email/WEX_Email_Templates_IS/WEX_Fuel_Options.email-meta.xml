    <textOnly>Hi ,
I was asked to reach out to you regarding your interest in our *** fuel card program.
Your business will have access to our industry leading fleet software providing:
convenience in fueling with no cash or receipts to touch, guard against fraud with our
card controls, and avoid wasting time collecting/saving receipts using our real-time
downloadable itemized reporting!
This brief video will show you how our cards work along with sample reporting -

I will send you a separate email with the program details. 
Please look for it in your
inbox or spam folder.
Please feel free to contact me with any questions. 
My direct number is 207-523-6066. I can also be reached via email.
I look forward to helping you control some fixed costs!
Thank you for your consideration.
