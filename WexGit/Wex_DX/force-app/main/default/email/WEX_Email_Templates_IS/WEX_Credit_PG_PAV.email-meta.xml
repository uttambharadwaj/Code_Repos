    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Due to the Patriot Act, Credit is requesting a “physical address verification” of the Personal Guarantor&apos;s residential address.
 
I simply need a copy of a utility bill or some formal document listing both the Personal Guarantor signers’ name and residential physical address to match what was provided on your application.   Feel free to either scan and email that to me or you can fax to over to me.
 
As soon as I receive it, I will forward it to credit so they can finalize the review of your application so we can get your new cards ordered.
 
Again, thank you for choosing WEX!
