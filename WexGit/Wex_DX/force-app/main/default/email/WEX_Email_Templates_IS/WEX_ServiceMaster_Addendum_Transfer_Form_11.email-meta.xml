    <subject>ServiceMaster Franchisees - WEX Fuel Card Program</subject>
    <textOnly>dWEX would like to introduce our Preferred National Account Fuel Card Program courtesy of our new corporate relationship with ServiceMaster Clean &amp; Restore.

We save you time. You’ll enjoy the convenience of a single card program to purchase fuel and service providing you with one, easy-to-read invoice. You can also easily download transaction data from the web right to QuickBooks or Excel each month.
We give you control. Detailed reports show how and where fueling and vehicle maintenance money was spent, so you can account for every penny.
We make it convenient. Your drivers only need to carry one card to purchase fuel and service at any participating location.

And we save you money…your franchise will share in a 1.7% rebate on your monthly fuel spend. This rebate will be credited monthly 30 days in arrears via your fuel statement.

Monthly Invoice = 30 days
Payment terms = 26 days
Credit line based on approval.

Please fill out the one page credit application entitled ServiceMaster Addendum along with attached transfer form, and WEX will contact you regarding account set-up.
