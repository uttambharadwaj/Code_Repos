    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Credit is requesting verification of the Personal Guaranty signer’s date of birth.
 
Please email or fax a copy of a third party document such as a driver’s license that contains both the name of the person who signed the Person Guaranty and their date of birth. 
 
As soon as I receive it, I will forward it to credit so they can finalize the review of your application so we can get your new cards ordered.
 
Again, thank you for choosing WEX!
