    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Thank you for your interest in the WEX Fuel Card program. As we discussed, the WEX Fuel Card is accepted at more than 90% of all retail fueling stations in the U.S. Your drivers can fuel wherever they are, whenever they need to.


And you can ensure they always get the best fuel price in town. Simply download our free smart phone app, WEX Connect. The app quickly guides your drivers to the nearest fuel locations and lists prices as they post by our current customers. You’ll find WEX Connect at https://www.wexinc.com/insights/blog/inside-wex/wex-connect/


You will find a complete list of accepting locations at www.wexinc.com/accepting-locations.


It’s easy to enroll. Simply complete the attached application form and fax it back to me at {!User.Fax}.

Meanwhile, please call me with any questions.




Sincerely,
