    <subject>Why Wex is Winning</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


I would like to take a moment and share with you why WEX IS WINNING. WEX is a leading provider of fleet fuel card programs in the United States.  As a result of our State of the Art Technology, WEX customers are Mitigating Risk and Growing Revenue, two vital elements for a profitable business.

Continuous Customer Improvement is one major reason why we are a leader in the industry.  Based on our customers&apos; input, last year we reinvested over 1.8 million dollars back into our products. WEX customers span all segments of business - Energy Companies, Federal Governments, Manufacturers, Package Goods, Retail, Service and Telecommunications. WEX always puts the needs of the customer first.

My name is {!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}, Regional Sales Manager with WEX, and I would like to discuss with you our Proprietary Network and New Product Innovations.  I am confident you will see the benefits of our programs and why WEX will be a great asset to your continued success.

Please use this link to select a time that works best for you to set up a brief meeting.  I look forward to meeting you.

Thank you,


Sincerely,
{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
