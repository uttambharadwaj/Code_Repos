    <textOnly>Good Morning {!User.FirstName},

I&apos;m reaching out to get you set-up!

WEX bank now extends credit for the Shell Fuel Card program.

Since you already have existing credit with WEX, we can apply some of that credit to the Shell account.

Please let me know if that is something you&apos;d like to do!
