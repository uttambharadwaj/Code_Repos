    <textOnly>Good Afternoon{!Contact.FirstName},

We received your application for the Shell Fuel Card Program, but Credit wasn&apos;t able to find any reported commercial credit with the info provided. 

Please let me if that is correct, or if there is another legal company name or a different physical address your business credit could be registered under.
