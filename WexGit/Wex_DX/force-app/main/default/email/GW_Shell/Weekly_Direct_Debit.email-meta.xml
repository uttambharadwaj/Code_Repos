    <textOnly>Good Afternoon {!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;m reaching out because you have been approved for our Weekly Debit Program on your Shell Fuel Card account.

With this plan, we simply debit your fleet program balance directly from your checking account daily for the previous week’s transactions.

Please take a few moments to fill out the attached form and send it back to me.

Please be sure to include a voided check.

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
