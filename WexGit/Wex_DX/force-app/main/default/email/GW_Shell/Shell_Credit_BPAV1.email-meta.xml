    <textOnly>Good Afternoon {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in the Shell Fuel Card Program!

To comply with the Patriot Act, credit needs you to verify your business’s physical address for approval.  Please provide documentation to verify your business&apos; address listed on your app.

To pass verification, the bank requires a copy of one of the following documents:

Utility bill or insurance document showing that the bill is mailed to the physical street address or that it services the physical address of the business
Lease agreement which identifies the business and the physical address of the office
Certified articles of incorporation
An unexpired government-issued business license.
Please reach out if you have any questions!


Sincerely, 

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
