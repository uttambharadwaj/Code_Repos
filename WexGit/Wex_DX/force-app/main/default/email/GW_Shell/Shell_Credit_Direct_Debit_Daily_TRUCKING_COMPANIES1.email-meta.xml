    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations! You have been approved for our Direct Debit Program on your Shell Fuel Card account.

Since you are a trucking company, our bank requires that your account be setup on Daily Direct Debit. With this plan, we simply debit your fleet program balance directly from your checking account daily for the previous day’s transactions.

Please take a few moments to fill out the attached form and either scan/email it to me at the email address noted below or fax it back to me at {!User.Fax}. Please be sure to include a voided check.

Thank you for choosing our fuel card program and feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
