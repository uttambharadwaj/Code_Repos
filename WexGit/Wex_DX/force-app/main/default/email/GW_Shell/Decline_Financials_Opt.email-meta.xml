    <textOnly>Good Afternoon{!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in our Shell Fuel Card Program!

To get you set-up, the bank can review your company&apos;s financials OR accept a deposit for our Secured Credit Line Program.


Financials Review:

The bank can review 2 years of financials for a credit line. 

They will need a balance sheet and profit &amp; loss statement for 2017 and 2018 from your CPA/accountant or accounting service.

Please reference attached examples.


Secured Credit Line Program

If you prefer, you may also send in a deposit to start the account. 

Please see attached document for instructions.

You can either mail the deposit to our bank or wire us the funds. 

When the deposit is received, your account will be set-up and the deposit amount will be your account credit line.

After 6 months of using the account, we can send you that deposit back and extend a credit line for your company!
