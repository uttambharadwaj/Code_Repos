    <subject>Telematics Can Help:  CITGO Fleet Card</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

By now, your CITGO fleet cards are adding flexibility and savings to your fuel and vehicle management.  But what if I told you that you can have even more control.


That’s right… whether you want to track driver behavior or stay on top of vehicle diagnostics, WEX Fleet Telematics can help! WEX Fleet Telematics integrates GPS data with your CITGO Fleet card to create enhanced visibility into your fleet.  This powerful tool will allow you to:

Know where your vehicles are, how long they stayed there,
and what routes they took
Uncover incidents of idling, harsh braking, and speeding that
are costing you money
Learn about vehicle problems in real time and stay on top
of scheduled service

WEX Fleet Telematics customers on average report:

10-20% lower fuel consumption*
26% increase in driver productivity*
13% lower maintenance costs*

Let me know what a good time would be to discuss how Fleet Telematics can help.
