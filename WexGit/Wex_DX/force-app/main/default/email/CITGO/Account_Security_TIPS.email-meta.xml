    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;

Thanks for choosing the CITGO fleet card program. Ensure your account stays secure with our four security tips.

1. Remind drivers that if an attendant swipes the card in the card reader, they should keep it in their sight and make sure the same card is returned to them.

2. Always review your reports or better yet, check transaction details at CITGO Fleet Online to watch for discrepancies or unusual purchase patterns.

3. Control access to your account by notifying us of changes to the authorized fleet contact(s).

4. When a vehicle will be out of use for a period of time, collect the card to keep it secure. If a vehicle is sold or retired, immediately cancel and destroy the assigned card.

We&apos;re here for you 24/7, so be sure to give us call at 1-866-926-5615 if you have any questions. Thanks again, and welcome to the CITGO fleet card Program!


Best regards,
