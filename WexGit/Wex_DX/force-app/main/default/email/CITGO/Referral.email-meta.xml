    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},

It&apos;s been a pleasure working with you to implement the CITGO Fleet program.

Do you have any business contacts that could use help saving on fuel for their vehicles? I am always looking to grow my network and help businesses save with CITGO.

As always, I am available if anything comes up. Remember that we also have 24/7 customer service at 1-866-926-5615, and you can also pull reports, add and delete cards and drivers anytime on your online account at CITGO Fleet Online.

Sincerely,
