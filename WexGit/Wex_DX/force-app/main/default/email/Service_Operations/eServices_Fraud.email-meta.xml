Thank you for contacting us. That card was used at a site where a card skimming device was discovered, and our fraud department emailed your office to advise they would terminate the card as a precaution. I have issued a new card with the same information, but with a different card number to prevent possible unauthorized charges. Please let me know if I may be of further assistance.
