Other than mailing a check, there are 3 online banking payment options for your Esso Business Card account.

On your bank’s website, you can set up “Esso Business Card” as a Payee and use your Esso Customer number: 0000112865 for the account number.

On our website: essofleetonline.com, you can go to:

Invoice &amp; Payment on the red bar

Direct Debit Enrollment – if you wish automatic payments to be taken each month

Set Up Bank Information - if you wish to submit your payments yourself each month

After making your choice between these 2, you:

Add Bank Account

Then follow the directions in the gray box to print off the Pre-authorized Debit Agreement, complete it, and return it to us with a voided check. The fax number is there, or you can send it by email to: iol_pad@wexinc.com
