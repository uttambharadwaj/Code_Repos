Thank you for contacting us. You can create a new driver ID number with the same driver name under Fleet Manager &gt; View Drivers. Click Clone in the Actions column for that driver, and then you will be prompted to add a new driver, but with the name already filled in. Designate a new driver ID number and then submit the record. Then go back to Fleet Manager &gt; View Drivers and click Terminate next to the old number to ensure it cannot be used again. Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Regards,
