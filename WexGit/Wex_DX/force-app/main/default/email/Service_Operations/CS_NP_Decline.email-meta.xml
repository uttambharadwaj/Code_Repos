Thank you for contacting us. In the future, you can navigate to: Reports &gt; AdHoc Reporting &gt; Authorization Activity and fill in the necessary information. This should populate a list of transactions which you can investigate. If no declines appear, it is likely that the card is damaged or demagnetized and you should consider ordering a replacement. Please let us know if we may be of further assistance.

Regards,
