Direct Debit Enrollment

Add Bank Account information. Click OK. Then click Submit on the Direct Debit Enrollment page to save it online.

Then follow the directions in the gray box to print off the Pre-authorized Debit Agreement, complete it, and return it to us with a voided check. The fax number is there, or you can send it by email to: iol_pad@wexinc.com
