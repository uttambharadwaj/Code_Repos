    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Per my voicemail, I wanted to send along some information about the Gulf Fleet Fueling Program. I think you’ll find the Program an ideal solution for your business.

Whether you’re looking for robust fuel rebates, nationwide card acceptance, or tighter control over your company vehicles, a Gulf Fleet Card is an extremely powerful tool in helping you more easily and cost-effectively manage your vehicles.

The Program&apos;s suite of online tools are designed to give you complete control over your fleet, including:


· Powerful Reporting. Know who bought what, when, where and for how much – available in hard copy and online.

· Broad Acceptance. Fuel and save at more than 2,300 Gulf sites nationwide, with card acceptance at over 90% of all U.S. fueling locations with the Gulf Universal Fleet Card.

· Purchase Controls. Help eliminate any misuse of company vehicles by setting purchase limits for each driver, with purchase alerts to keep you well informed.

· Live U.S.-based Customer Service. Award-winning customer assistance for you and your drivers 24/7.

I am including Program information and an application for your review. The application is the first step in getting set up with the Gulf Card. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I’ll also plan to follow up with you soon.

I hope we&apos;ll have the opportunity to serve your needs.
