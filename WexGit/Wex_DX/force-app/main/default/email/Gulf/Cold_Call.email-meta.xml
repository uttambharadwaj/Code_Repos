    <subject>IMPORTANT: Fleet Fuel Savings from Gulf</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

My name is Bernabe Juntura and I&apos;m the Regional Sales Manager for the Gulf Fleet Fueling Program.

We help businesses like yours save upwards of 15% on overall vehicle management costs, including a competitive rebate of up to 5 cents off per gallon every time you fuel at Gulf using the Gulf Commercial Fleet Card or the Gulf Universal Fleet Card.

Whether you’re looking for a fleet card program with robust rebates at over 2,500 fueling locations, nationwide card acceptance, or tighter control over your company vehicles, Gulf has a fleet fueling program that’s just right for your business.

I&apos;ll be in your area next week and would like to briefly speak with you about your current fuel program, and share some additional information about Gulf’s. I&apos;ll call to schedule a time.

Many thanks,

Toni Clemens
