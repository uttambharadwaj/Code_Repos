    <subject>Thanks for visiting Gulf Fleet Cards at New England Grows!</subject>
    <textOnly>Thank you for visiting the Gulf Fleet Cards booth at New England Grows 2013. We appreciate your interest in Gulf’s Fleet Fueling Program and its ability to help your business save significantly on the cost to fuel (and manage) company vehicles.

With helpful expense controls, convenient reporting tools and savings of up to 5¢* off on every gallon of fuel purchased at Gulf, your company can quickly see the savings add up. Plus, as an attendee of New England Grows 2013, you can save another 10¢ off per gallon for the first 3 months when you apply for a Gulf Fleet Card by March 31, 2013!**

I’ll be in touch with additional information about the Gulf Fleet Fueling Program and how your business can benefit. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.

All my best,

Bob Everts
