    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for taking the time to go through the card set-up process. I have attached the Fleet Data Form I completed while we were talking. Please keep this for your records.


You should receive a package in the mail in the next few days. The package will contain your new cards. Instructions on how to access your online account will be included.


Just a reminder: The cards are active when you receive them, but without the driver PINs they cannot be used to make purchases. Each driver is required to enter their unique PIN and their vehicle odometer reading in order to make a purchase.


Please feel free to call me if any questions come up. As your dedicated Gulf Regional Fleet Manager, my ability to help at this stage is limited, but I will do what I can to provide assistance. Alternatively, you may also call the Customer Service number that will be located on the back of your cards. They’re available 24/7 to serve your needs.


Thank you for your business. We’re looking forward to working with you.
