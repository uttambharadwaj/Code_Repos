    <subject>Thank you for our meeting re: the Gulf Commercial Fleet Card.</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me yesterday and for your commitment to the Gulf Fleet Fueling Program. The Gulf Commercial Card will be a significant help in managing your fuel costs and your vehicles. To recap, here are some of the benefits of the Gulf Program:


· Powerful Reporting. Know who bought what, when, where and for how much – available in hard copy and online.

· Broad Acceptance. Fuel and save at more than 2,300 Gulf sites nationwide.

· Purchase Controls. Help eliminate any misuse of company vehicles by setting purchase limits for each driver, with purchase alerts to keep you well informed.

· Live U.S.-based Customer Service. Award-winning customer assistance for you and your drivers 24/7.

I have attached a partially completed credit application for you. Please fill out the remainder of page one, sign it and email it back to me. I have also included the Fleet Data Form for your completion (it may be sent back along with the credit application). Just a reminder to also send me your federal fuel tax form.


I’ll follow up with you over the next couple of days to see how things are going. However please absolutely feel free to call or email me if any questions arise in the interim.


Many thanks,
