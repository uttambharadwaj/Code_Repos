    <subject>Exclusive Savings: Commonwealth of MA Fleet Fuel Program</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS has negotiated special terms with WEX and Gulf Oil to offer your organization a fleet fueling program with exclusive fuel rebates* and cost-saving benefits – designed to give you complete control over your business fleet:


REBATES:

• Monthly fuel rebates based on the Commonwealth’s fuel spend

• 3¢ off per gallon when you fuel at Mass Pike and Cumberland Farms locations

• 2¢ off per gallon when you fuel at any other Gulf-branded location


BENEFITS:

• Online tools that allow you to set driver spending limits, receive purchase alerts, and see what your drivers are buying, where, when &amp; for how much

• Detailed reporting, including vehicle performance data

• Tax exemption for qualified fleets

• An “early pay” rebate

• Access to over 90% of U.S. fueling locations, including over 2,500 Gulf stations

• No set-up or monthly card fees

• Easy, online account management and bill payment

• Award-winning 24/7 customer service

• And more…


I’d like to review the Commonwealth program with you in a brief meeting or phone call. I’ll connect with you this week to set up a date and time. Feel free to contact me by email or phone if you’d like to talk sooner.

Thank you,
