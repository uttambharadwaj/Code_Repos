    <subject>Next Steps for the Gulf Fleet Fueling Program (Card Set-up)</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Now that your Gulf Fleet application has been received and submitted for approval, I want to prepare you for next steps. Assuming the application is approved, I will reach out to you to ask the following questions regarding your preferences for card set-up:


1. How many cards are you going to need? (Spare cards are generally recommended as a back- up as there is a cost for replacement cards.)

2. Do you want the cards to be fuel only or set up for custom controls?

3. What company name would you like embossed on the card? (20 character limit)

4. What information do you want on the second line of embossing? e.g. vehicle #, department, etc.

5. Would you like to choose the PIN that we assign to each of your drivers, or would you like me to generate random #’s that you can change when you receive the cards?

This process is easy and usually very quick.


As always you are welcome to reach out to me if you have any questions. And if you’d like to go ahead and submit responses to the questions above, please feel free to do so via email. Otherwise, I’ll look forward to following up with you soon.


Thank you.
