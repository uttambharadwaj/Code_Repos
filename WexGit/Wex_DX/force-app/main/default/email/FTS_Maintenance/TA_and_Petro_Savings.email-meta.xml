    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to make sure you knew about all the savings you can get with your FTS membership from TA and Petro. In addition to fuel discounts, you can also get great savings on maintenance services and breakdown services with RoadSquad Connect.

To learn more about these savings, take a look at the attached document, and if you have any questions, give us a call at (800) 749-1724 Opt. 2.

Thank you,
