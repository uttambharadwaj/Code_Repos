    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},
My name is {!Contact.OwnerFullName}, an Account Executive with EFS and T-Chek.  I attempted to contact you to discuss how our fuel card program can save you time, money and provide you the account security you need.

As I mentioned in my message, I look forward to speaking with you personally regarding the specific benefits of our fuel card program and how they relate to your business.

I realize how valuable your time is.  Please let me know when a good time to connect would be and I will be happy to get in touch with you.

Sincerely,
