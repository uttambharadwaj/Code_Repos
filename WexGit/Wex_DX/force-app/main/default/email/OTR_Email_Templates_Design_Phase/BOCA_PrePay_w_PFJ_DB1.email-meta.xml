Thank you for choosing a Pre-Paid Fleet One EDGE account. Please remember that you, the customer, are responsible to make sure that the funds are in the account before attempting to use the cards. When the available balance hits $0.00, the account will be shut-off from further use until more funds are added.



In order to fund your account, you may make payments by bank wire, ACH, or Western Union. All payments must be received by 3:30 PM CST in order for those funds to be available that day.
