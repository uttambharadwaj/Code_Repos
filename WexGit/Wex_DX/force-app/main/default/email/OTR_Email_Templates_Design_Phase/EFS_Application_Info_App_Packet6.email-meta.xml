Application Instructions, by attachment:

Ø EFS Application and Agreement

This is the APPLICATION for the new account, and the most important document.

Ø EFS Account Data Sheet

general setup questions for how you want your limits set up.
When in doubt, write “default.”
Any decision you make here can be easily changed later when an Implementation Specialist calls you and walks you through your online account.

Ø EFS Pre-Fund Agreement (only for PrePay accounts)

This is the form acknowledging that you want a PREPAY account.
Please sign and return the second page back to me.
Please wait to fund your new account until I have provided you an Application ID#. VERY IMPORTANT!

Ø Direct Debit Form (only for Credit Line accounts)

Form Required to set up direct debit (ACH) if you chose this option on the application

Ø Personal Guaranty (only for Credit Line accounts)


Form used if you would like to apply for a credit line using a personal guaranty
This form is optional
Although not required, a personal guaranty often helps your chances of credit approval, especially if your business is less than 2 years old and your company does not have financial statements (income statement and balance sheet) readily available


If you have any questions about the application or your new fuel card program, please don’t hesitate to call or email me. We look forward to a long relationship with {!Account.Name}.
