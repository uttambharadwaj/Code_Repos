Please reply:  I approve.   Name and Date.




To WEX/EFS/FleetOne :



This is to confirm that I was in no way expressly, directly nor indirectly solicited regarding my decision to join Fleet One and to seek separation from my existing card provider.   I solely, upon my own decision and volition contacted Fleet One on my own.   As a result of my inquiry, a representative contacted me to follow up on my inquiry, welcomed my company to EFS/Fleet One EDGE card, and answered my questions concerning my newly sought after account.
