    <textOnly>Greetings {!Contact.FirstName},



Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today about opening an EFS account for {!Account.Name}.



I hope the information I have provided below is useful in making your decision. (Please note there is an attachment that is just informational in nature.)



Please let me know if you have any questions.

Application Instructions, by attachment:

Ø EFS WEX Payables Account Application

This is the APPLICATION for the new account, and the most important document. We only need you to complete pages 1-3.


Ø Data Sheet

Please make sure to sign this form.
When in doubt, write &quot;default.&quot;

Ø Direct Debit Form

Form Required to verify banking information.

Ø Personal Guaranty (only for Credit Line accounts)


Form used if you would like to apply for a credit line using a personal guaranty
This form is optional
Although not required, a personal guaranty often helps your chances of credit approval, especially if your business is less than 2 years old and your company does not have financial statements (income statement and balance sheet) readily available


If you have any questions about the application or your new MasterCard program, please don’t hesitate to call or email me. We look forward to a long relationship with {!Account.Name}.
