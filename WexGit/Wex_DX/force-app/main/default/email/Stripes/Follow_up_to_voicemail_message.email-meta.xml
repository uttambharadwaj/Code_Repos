    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Per my voicemail, I wanted to send along some information about The Stripes Fleet Card Program. I think you’ll find the Program an ideal solution for your business.

Whether you’re looking for robust fuel rebates, nationwide card acceptance, or tighter control over your company vehicles, a Stripes Fleet Card is an extremely powerful tool in helping you more easily and cost-effectively manage your vehicles.

The Program&apos;s suite of online tools are designed to give you complete control over your fleet, including:

· Powerful Reporting. Know who bought what, when, where and for how much – available in hard copy and online.

· Broad Acceptance. Fuel and save at more than 700 Stripes Stores - regardless of the fuel brand at the pumps - with card acceptance at over 90% of all U.S. fueling locations with the Stripes Universal Fleet Card.

· Purchase Controls. Help eliminate any misuse of company vehicles by setting purchase limits for each driver, with purchase alerts to keep you well informed.

· Live U.S.-based Customer Service. Award-winning customer assistance for you and your drivers 24/7.

I am including Program information and an application for your review. The application is the first step in getting set up with a Stripes Fleet Card. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I’ll also plan to follow up with you soon.

I hope we&apos;ll have the opportunity to serve your needs.

Many thanks,
