    <subject>Controlling your vehicle expenses with The Stripes Fleet Card Program.</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

My name is John Saenz and I&apos;m the Authorized Representative for The Stripes Fleet Card Program.

We help businesses like yours save upwards of 15% on overall vehicle management and fueling costs, including competitive fuel rebates on every gallon whenever you fuel at over 700 Stripes® Stores, regardless of the fuel brand on the pumps.

Whether you’re looking for a fleet card program with easy-set cost controls, in-depth reporting, robust rebates, nationwide card acceptance, or the ability to save hours of administrative time managing your fleet vehicles and expenses, Stripes has an ideal fleet card solution for your business.

I would like to share some additional information about The Stripes Fleet Card Program, and speak with you about your current fuel program and needs. I&apos;ll be in touch to schedule some time to meet.

Many thanks,

John Saenz
