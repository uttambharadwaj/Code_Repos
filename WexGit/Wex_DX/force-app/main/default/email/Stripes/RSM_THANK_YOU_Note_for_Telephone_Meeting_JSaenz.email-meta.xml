    <subject>Thank you for discussing The Stripes Fleet Card Program.</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks again for your interest in The Stripes Fleet Card Program, and for taking the time to talk with me.

I think you’ll find our Program to be an ideal solution for your business, helping you more cost-effectively manage your fleet of vehicles. Whether you’re looking for a fleet card program with robust rebates or nationwide card acceptance, a Stripes Fleet Card is an extremely powerful tool.

As we discussed, our Program also includes a suite of online tools to help you save hours of administrative time and significantly drive down your fleet costs, including:

· Powerful Reporting. Know who bought what, when, where and for how much – available in hard copy and online.

· Broad Acceptance. Fuel and save at more than 700 Stripes Stores - regardless of the fuel brand at the pumps - with card acceptance at over 90% of all U.S. fueling locations with the Stripes Universal Fleet Card.

· Purchase Controls. Help eliminate any misuse of company vehicles by setting purchase limits for each driver, with purchase alerts to keep you well informed.

· Live U.S.-based Customer Service. Award-winning customer assistance for you and your drivers 24/7.

As promised, I am passing along some helpful Program information and an application. The application is the first step in getting you set up with a Stripes Fleet Card. Feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I’ll also plan to follow up with you soon.

Thanks again for your time. We’ll look forward to working with you.

Sincerely,


John Saenz
