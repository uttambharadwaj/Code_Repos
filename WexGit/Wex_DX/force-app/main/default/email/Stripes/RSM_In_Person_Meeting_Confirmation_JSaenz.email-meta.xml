    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks again for your interest in The Stripes Fleet Card Program.

I&apos;m emailing to confirm our scheduled meeting on &lt;date&gt; at &lt;time&gt;. I look forward to talking with you about your fleet fueling and management needs, and how the Stripes Program can help. I think you&apos;ll find the Program an ideal fit for your business.

If you have any questions before our meeting, please do not hesitate to call. Otherwise I&apos;ll plan to see you soon.

Many thanks,
