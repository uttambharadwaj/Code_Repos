    <subject>Per my voice mail message - information on the WEX Fleet One OTR Fuel Card</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Hopefully you received the email I sent you the other day.  In case you didn’t, I am taking the liberty of sending you another copy.


Again, I am wondering if you could give me some advice. We help organizations like {!Account.Name} with reducing the operating cost of their fleet operation.  I don’t know whom I need to speak with to see if we can help you in this area.

This is where I need some help from you.  Who would be the individual (within your organization), if not you, that you would recommend I meet with to look at our services to see if there’s a potential fit?

Specifically what we do is:

- Give you savings – cash price and no transaction fees.

- Provide driver convenience – accepted at 99% of truck stops in the US.
- Provide control – real time authorization of card and driver ID.

You can review several testimonials and videos from our customers that tell the story of how:

- WEX Fleet One provides the most detailed reporting in the industry.
- WEX Fleet One Customer Service is unparalleled in the industry.
- WEX Fleet One customers realize significant cost savings.

I don’t know if we could duplicate these kinds of results with your company, but wouldn’t it be interesting to find out?

I look forward to speaking with you. And, thank you for any advice you can give me.

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
