    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I have been in contact with MAIN CONTACT NAME HERE and they determined you would be the person I should meet with to review how your company manages fleet operations to see if my company can reduce your costs or help you gain more control over your expenses.


We help organizations like {!Account.Name} with reducing the operating cost of their fleet operation.


Specifically what we do is:

- Give you savings – cash price and no transaction fees.

- Provide driver convenience – accepted at 99% of truck stops in the US.
- Provide control – real time authorization of card and driver ID.

You can review several testimonials and videos from our customers that tell the story of how:

- WEX Fleet One provides the most detailed reporting in the industry.
- WEX Fleet One Customer Service is unparalleled in the industry.
- WEX Fleet One customers realize significant cost savings.

I don’t know if we could duplicate these kinds of results with your company, but wouldn’t it be interesting to find out?

I look forward to meeting with you.

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
