Dear {!Case.Account}:

There are two payment options available on our website:

Manual Online Payments - You must log in and initiate each payment you make

Direct Debit - We automatically pull the balance due each month.



Each option requires that you apply for that specific option online:



Manual Online Payment:

Go to INVOICE &amp; PAYMENT &gt; MAKE PAYMENT &gt; Enter Bank Information &gt; Add Bank Account.

Enter your banking information and click SUBMIT at the bottom of the screen.

You can find a link to the PAD form near the bottom of the page where you’ll see the phrase ‘PAD Agreement is available to download as a PDF’




Direct Debit:

Go to INVOICE &amp; PAYMENT &gt; DIRECT DEBIT ENROLLMENT and click ADD BANK ACCOUNT.

Enter your banking information and click SUBMIT on the bottom of the screen.

You can find a link to the PAD form near the bottom of the page where you’ll see the phrase ‘PAD Agreement is available to download as a PDF’




You will need to Email or Fax the PAD Agreement and Voided Check to: iol_pad@wexinc.com



Within two business days, the PAD form will be approved, and you will receive a confirmation email and the bank account status will change from PENDING to ACTIVE.


Let us know if you have any questions.
