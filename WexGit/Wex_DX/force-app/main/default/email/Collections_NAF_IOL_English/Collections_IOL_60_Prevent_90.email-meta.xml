Dear {!Case.Account}:

Your reply is requested. Your fuel account has now reached a serious level of delinquency for the following invoices.


Total Owed on Account: {!Case.Rollup_Total_Owed_Amount__c}

Past Due Amount: {!Case.Rollup_Past_Due_Amount__c}

Current Due Amount: {!Case.Rollup_Current_Due_Amount__c}


NOTE: If your account does go more than 3 invoice cycles outstanding it will require a full Security Deposit.


We want to work with you to avoid further delinquency and escalation of your account.


Please pay the full balance OR consider paying the oldest invoice to prevent a required review.


We encourage online payments through your bankâ€™s website OR our online portal.


Payments made through our Portal will post that evening if scheduled before 3:30pm EST


If you cannot make a payment please respond to this email or call today.
