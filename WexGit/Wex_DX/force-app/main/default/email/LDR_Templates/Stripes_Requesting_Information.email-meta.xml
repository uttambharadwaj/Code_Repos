    <textOnly>Hello, {!Lead.FirstName}-

I would like to speak with you concerning your fuel purchases to determine if Stripes has an opportunity to help you save time and money, including 20¢ off per gallon for 60 days followed by our standard, competitive monthly program rebates. Please answer these brief questions below and I can determine if you’re a good candidate for our program.

How many vehicles is your company running?
How are you currently purchasing fuel for these vehicles?
Who is the best person to speak with about these fuel purchases?

I look forward to speaking with you soon.
