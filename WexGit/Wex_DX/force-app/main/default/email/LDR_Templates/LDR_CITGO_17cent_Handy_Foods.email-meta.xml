    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I would like to see if we can potentially save you both time and money! The CITGO Fleet card program has been able to save companies up to 15% in their overall fuel costs*.

Before I dive deeper into our program I would like to find out a little more about your business to make sure you would be able to maximize the benefits of our program.

How many vehicles does your company have in use?
What method do you use to purchase fuel for those vehicles?
Who would be the best person to speak with about your fleet needs?

LOWER FUEL COSTS

Prevent unauthorized card use by using our detailed transaction reports which identify unique driver spending.

SAVE TIME

Eliminate administrative time sorting through receipts and reimbursing drivers.

Reduce time spent on fiscal reporting with our month to-date and year-to-date reporting.



CONVENIENCE &amp; SAVINGS

Access to over 5,500 CITGO locations in 27 states, and the option for more flexibility with our Universal Card welcome at over 90% of all U.S. fueling locations.

Earn valuable rebates of up to 5 cents per gallon when fueling at CITGO locations**.


You can reach me at {!User.Phone} or via email at {!User.Email}. I look forward to speaking with you about the needs of your business.



Sincerely,
