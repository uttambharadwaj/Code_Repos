    <textOnly>Hello, {!Lead.FirstName}-

Who knows when there may be a pest emergency.  Circle K&apos;s Universal card allows your employees access to over 95% of fueling stations nationwide; allowing them to easily fuel up at any hour if necessary.

Additional savings today!  You&apos;ll save 10¢ per gallon for 6 months if you sign up this month!  Please answer questions below and I can determine if you’re a good candidate for our program.

How many vehicles is your company running?
How are you currently purchasing fuel for those vehicles?
Who is the best person to speak with about those fuel purchases?

I look forward to speaking with you soon.
