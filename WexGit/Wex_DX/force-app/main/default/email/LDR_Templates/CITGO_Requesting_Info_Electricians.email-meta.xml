    <subject>Electricians - Power your fuel with SAVINGS at CITGO</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

With emergency house calls and unpredictable schedules, your workers may not know where they&apos;ll end up throughout the day - a big problem when vehicles run low on fuel.  Our CITGO Universal card provides your employees access to 95% of all stations nationwide!

Additional savings today!  You&apos;ll save 10¢ per gallon for 6 months if you sign up this month! Please answer questions below and I can determine if you’re a good candidate for our program.

How many vehicles is your company running?
How are you currently purchasing fuel for those vehicles?
Who is the best person to speak with about those fuel purchases?

I look forward to speaking with you soon.
