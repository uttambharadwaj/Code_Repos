    <textOnly>Hello, {!Lead.FirstName}-

Checking in with you one last time.  Wawa works hard to help businesses track their fueling expenses, saving you time and money.

I&apos;ve had trouble reaching you via phone.  I&apos;d love to hear back from you.  Please answer questions below or call me and I can determine if youâ€™re a good candidate for our program.

How many vehicles is your company running?
How are you currently purchasing fuel for those vehicles?
Who is the best person to speak with about those fuel purchases?

I look forward to speaking with you soon!  Thank you for your time.
