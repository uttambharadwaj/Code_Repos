    <textOnly>Hello, {!Lead.FirstName}-

I would like to speak with you concerning your fuel purchases to see if Circle K has an opportunity to help you save time &amp; money. We are able to save fleets up to 15% in their overall fuel costs. Please answer questions below and I can determine if you’re a good candidate for our program.

How many vehicles is your company running?
How are you currently purchasing fuel for those vehicles?
Who is the best person to speak with about those fuel purchases?


I look forward to speaking with you soon.
