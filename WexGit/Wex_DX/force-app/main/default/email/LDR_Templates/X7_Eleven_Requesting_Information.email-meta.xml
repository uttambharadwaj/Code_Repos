    <textOnly>Hello, {!Lead.FirstName}-

I would like to speak with you concerning your fuel purchases to determine if 7-Eleven has an opportunity to help you save time and money, including 7 months of 11¢ off per gallon* on fuel purchased at 7-Eleven with the 7-Eleven Fuel Card. Please answer these brief questions and I can determine if you’re a good candidate for this program.

How many vehicles is your company running?
How are you currently purchasing fuel for these vehicles?
Who is the best person to speak with about these fuel purchases?

I look forward to speaking with you soon.
