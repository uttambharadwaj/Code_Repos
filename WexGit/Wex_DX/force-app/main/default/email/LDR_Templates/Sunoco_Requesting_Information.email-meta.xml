    <textOnly>Hello, {!Lead.FirstName}-

I would like to speak with you regarding your fuel purchases to see if Sunoco has an opportunity to help you save time and money including 15¢ off every gallon at Sunoco for the first 6 months.* Please answer the brief questions below and I can determine if you’re a good candidate for our program.

How many vehicles is your company running?
How are you currently purchasing fuel for those vehicles?
Who is the best person to speak with about those fuel purchases?

I look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you.
