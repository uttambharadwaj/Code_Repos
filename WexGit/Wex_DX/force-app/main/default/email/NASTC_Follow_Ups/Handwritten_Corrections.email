{!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on being approved for a NASTC Fleet One fuel card. In order to get the cards finalized, I need to have you hand write in the 2 week days you wish to have your account drafted in the Payment Information section of the application on page 2.  

Once you have done this please email it back to me at {!User.Email}.  

Thank you
