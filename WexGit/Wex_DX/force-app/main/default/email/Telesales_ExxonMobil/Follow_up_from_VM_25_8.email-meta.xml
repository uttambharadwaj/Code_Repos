    <subject>ExxonMobil Follow up from Voicemail</subject>
    <textOnly>Per my voice mail, I wanted to give you an overview of the ExxonMobil Fleet card program. I know you will find it the perfect tool to help you save money and time when it comes to managing your business vehicles.


Savings

Save 25 cents/gallon for 8 weeks,* then up to 6 cents per gallon** every time you fuel at any Exxon or Mobil-branded stations
No set up, monthly or annual fees
Plus you can use the free loyalty program Plenti to help you reward and retain your drivers

Convenience &amp; Control

Accepted at nearly 11,000 Exxon- and Mobil-branded stations nationwide
Easy online controls so you can set spending limits and monitor driver behavior
Smart phone app to make managing your program while on the go even easier


I will be following up with you next week. In the meantime, you can reach me at {!User.Phone} or via email at {!User.Email}.


I look forward to helping you save time and money for your business.


Sincerely,</textOnly>
