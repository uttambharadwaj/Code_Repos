    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


We&apos;ve noticed that {!Account.Name} has been a member of TruckersB2B since {!Account.Member_Signup_Date__c}, but hasn&apos;t received a rebate since {!Account.00NU0000003MvWR}.

We want to make sure you are getting your share.

I&apos;ve attached an updated overview sheet that lists all of the ways we can help your fleet save. Please feel free to call or email me if you would like more information on any of our programs.
