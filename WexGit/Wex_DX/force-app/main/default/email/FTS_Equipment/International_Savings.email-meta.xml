    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to make sure you knew about our International® new trucks rebate program. As an FTS Plus+ member, you can save up to $1000 on all new International DuraStar®, Lonestar®, 9900i®, PayStar®, ProStar®, TranStar®, and WorkStar® trucks. No matter what price you pay, the rebate stays the same.

International DuraStar — $450 Rebate
International LoneStar — $1,000 Rebate
International ProStar — $1,000 Rebate
International 9900i — $1,000 Rebate
International TranStar — $750 Rebate
International PayStar — $1,000 Rebate
International WorkStar — $750 Rebate


Just visit an International truck dealer, negotiate your best price on any approved truck, and fax a copy of your invoice to us at 877.902.1498. We will process your invoice(s), and the rebate will appear as a credit on your FTS card.

For full details and to find an authorized dealer, please visit ftsplus.com/international.
