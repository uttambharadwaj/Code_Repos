    <subject>are you available to discuss your fuel needs?</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;ve left you another voicemail, as I am hoping we can connect regarding {!Opportunity.Account}&apos;s fuel needs and vehicle operations. I think the Marathon Fleet Program may be a good fit.



When is a good time to talk? We are running a promotion in which you will save 10 cents per gallon for 6 months when fueling at Marathon locations,  It is only available through September 30, 2019, so I am hoping we can connect soon.



Thanks,
