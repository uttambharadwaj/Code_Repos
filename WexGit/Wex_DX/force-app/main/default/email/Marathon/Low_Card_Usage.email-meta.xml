I&apos;ve noticed that your account usage seems lower than we anticipated. Have you been able to fully implement the program with your drivers?

If you need assistance getting the program going, or are running into some roadblocks, I&apos;m here to help. Give me a call or email anytime.

Also, remember that you can easily make changes to your Marathon account in two ways:

· 1.) By Phone: Customer Service is available 7 days a week, 24 hours a day at 1-866-544-0699.


· 2.) Online: You can make changes online anytime by visiting www.marathonfleetcard.com/login


Please see attached PDF for helpful videos on how to use your online account tool.
