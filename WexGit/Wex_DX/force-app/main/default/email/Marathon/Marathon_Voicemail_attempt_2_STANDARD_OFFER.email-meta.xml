    <subject>Are you available to discuss your fuel needs?</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;ve left you another voicemail, as I am hoping we can connect regarding {!Opportunity.Account}&apos;s fuel needs and vehicle operations. I think the Marathon Fleet Program may be a good fit.

When is a good time to talk? I am hoping we can connect soon.


Thanks,
