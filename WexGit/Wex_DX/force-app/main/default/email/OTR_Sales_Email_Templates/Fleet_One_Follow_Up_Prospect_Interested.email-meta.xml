    <subject>Fleet One:  Following up with you</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I just tried calling and I wanted to send you a quick email in case this is more convenient for you. I am following up on your recent interest in our fuel card.

The Fleet One EDGE card offers the most extensive and comprehensive fuel discount network available with fuel discounts at over 3,600 sites. With an average savings of 15 cents per gallon* and thousands of additional savings, the Fleet One EDGE card provides all the tools you need to keep your fleet moving.

I would love to go over the Fleet One EDGE card and its benefits in detail with you and to answer any questions you may have.

Please feel free to give me a call back or use the link below to book a time for us to speak with 1 click. Otherwise, I will try you back tomorrow.

Customers’ expected savings may differ depending on location. Additionally, the card is accepted at locations that do not participate in Fleet One EDGE network pricing at all.”</textOnly>
