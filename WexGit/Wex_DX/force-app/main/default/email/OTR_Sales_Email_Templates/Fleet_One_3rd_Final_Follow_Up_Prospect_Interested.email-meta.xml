*The stated savings is based on the average discount available to Fleet One EDGE customers across all participating Fleet One EDGE merchants during a recent survey period, and does not represent a guarantee of future pricing. Customers’ expected savings may differ depending on location. Additionally, the card is accepted at locations that do not participate in Fleet One EDGE network pricing at all.

**In-network sites include Pilot Flying J, AMBEST, Circle K, Quick Fuel, Petroleum Wholesale, Sapp Bros., Speedway, and many more.”</textOnly>
