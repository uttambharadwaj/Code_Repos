Dear {!Case.Contact},


We received your request to be removed from the Direct Debit Payment program and be placed on standard monthly billing.  In response to your request, a credit review was conducted.  Unfortunately, we are not able to remove your account from the Direct Debit program.  Your request can, however, be accommodated if you elect to secure your account in full with a Letter of Credit or Security Deposit.  Based on your average use over the last 6-12 months, we recommend securing your credit line for $ XXXXX .00.  You may choose to secure your line for any amount; your credit line will be set at the amount you have secured it.  If you choose to provide a security deposit, please complete the enclosed Deposit Agreement and return a signed copy along with a certified check to the address above.
