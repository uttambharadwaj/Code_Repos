Re: Credit Line Increase Decline, Reconsider with Financial Statements


Account Number#: *********{!Case.Masked_External_Account__c}


Dear {!Case.Contact},


We received your request for a credit line increase on your account.  Based on your current credit profile we are unable to increase the credit line to an appropriate amount.  Although we cannot increase the credit line right now we will reconsider a credit line increase with receipt of the last two years of financial statements, not tax returns. At a minimum we need the income statement and balance sheet for both full fiscal years. (Audited preferred)  If this alternative is feasible, please submit the statements and we will review these financial statements in accordance with our credit policy.


Our reasons for not granting the increase credit line include the following:


A.  Credit Line

1.  Slow or delinquent payment history in the last 12 months.

2.  Limited or no actual usage in the last 6-12 months.

3.  Your account has not been open for at least 12 months.


B.  Business Credit

1.  Delinquent past or present credit obligations.

2.  Unsatisfactory financial conditions and/or rating.

3.  Insufficient information.

4.  Presence of suits, liens, or judgments.


C.  Financial Information

1.  Unsatisfactory conditions present.

2.  Insufficient financial strength to support original credit line.

3.  Updated financial statements have not been received.


D.  Other

1.  Supportive or additional information has not been received.

2.  Adverse information received from outside sources.


Sincerely,

Credit Services

WEX Bank
