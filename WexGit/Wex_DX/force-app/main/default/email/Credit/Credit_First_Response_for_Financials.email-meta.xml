RE: Initial Request for Information Required for Annual Account Review

Dear {!Case.Contact},

WEX Bank is an FDIC insured financial institution and, as such and pursuant to the terms and conditions of your account, is required to maintain current financial statements on our customers by obtaining them annually. We use these financial statements to properly assess the credit worthiness of your company. This may be the first time you have provided these statements to WEX Bank, but this request will be an annual request going forward.

Annually, a credit review of all large customers is conducted. To facilitate an accurate and expeditious review of your account, please provide the following information by {!TODAY() +30} to the analyst outlined below:

1. Complete set of audited, reviewed, compiled, or internal financial statements for the last two complete fiscal years, including the Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, Balance Sheet, Statement of Equity and footnotes, and

2. Interim Financial Statements for the current year, if any, including the Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, Balance Sheet, and footnotes

Note: The financials provided should match the contracting entity. If they do not match, a cross corporate guaranty would be required to use financials for a different legal entity under contract.

This information should be forwarded to {!Case.OwnerFullName} via email {!Case.OwnerEmail}. Please be assured that we consider information provided by you in response to this request to be confidential. We will safeguard such information in accordance with our policies for handling confidential information.

Please note your account will remain at its current credit limit until a credit review can be performed. If we do not receive your financial information in a timely manner, we will have to perform our review on commercial credit information alone. Your current credit limit is a maximum and includes both billed and unbilled purchases. Your service may be temporarily interrupted if your purchasing exceeds the credit limit.

If you have any questions please email {!Case.OwnerFullName} at {!Case.OwnerEmail}.

Sincerely,
{!Case.OwnerFullName}
