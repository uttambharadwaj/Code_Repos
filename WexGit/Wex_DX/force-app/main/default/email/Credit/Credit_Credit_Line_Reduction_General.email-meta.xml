Slow or delinquent payment history in the last 12 months/NSF’s.
Actual credit line usage in the last 12 months.
Updated financial statements have not been received.
Insufficient financial strength to support original credit line.
Adverse information received from outside sources.
Adverse information noted on personal guarantor’s credit report.

Sincerely,
