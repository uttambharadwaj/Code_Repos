2.  Limited or no actual usage in the last 6-12 months.

3.  Your account has not been open for at least six months.


B.  Business Credit

1.  Delinquent past or present credit obligations.

2.  Unsatisfactory financial conditions/rating.

3.  Insufficient information.

4.  Presence of suits, liens, or judgments.


C.  Financial Information

1.  Unsatisfactory conditions present.

2.  Insufficient financial strength to support requested credit line.

3.  Updated financial statements have not been received.


D.  Other

1.  Supportive or additional information has not been received.

2.  Adverse information received from outside sources.


Sincerely,

Credit Services
