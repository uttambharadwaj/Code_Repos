Dear {!Case.Contact},


We received your request to release the personal guarantor securing your account. Unfortunately, we are unable to process this request for the following reason(s):


Your account has not been open for at least one year.
Your account has a slow or unsatisfactory payment history.
Your commercial credit history does not support an unsecured credit line.

Sincerely,

Credit Services


WEX Bank
