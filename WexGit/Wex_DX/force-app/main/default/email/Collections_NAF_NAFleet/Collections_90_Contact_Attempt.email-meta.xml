Dear {!Case.Account}:

Your urgent reply is required. Your fuel account is significantly past due and needs payment to avoid any risk of further escalation.

We strongly encourage you to pay the full past due balance to bring the account current.

Total Owed on Account: {!Case.Rollup_Total_Owed_Amount__c}

Past Due Amount: {!Case.Rollup_Past_Due_Amount__c}

Current Due Amount: {!Case.Rollup_Current_Due_Amount__c}

NOTE: Your account is now at risk of escalation to 3rd party collections

We want to work with you to avoid further delinquency and escalation of your account

If youâ€™re not able to pay the balance in full at this time, please consider paying the oldest invoice to avoid 3rd party collections, or call in to request a weekly payment arrangement.
