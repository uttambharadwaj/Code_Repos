Dear {!Case.Account}:

To close the account we require a written request on company letterhead requesting the termination. The letter should reflect the account number to be closed, as well as the name and position title of the signer. The letter needs to be signed by a person of authority within the company, or an existing authorized user. Please submit the completed and signed letter to customer service to be processed.
