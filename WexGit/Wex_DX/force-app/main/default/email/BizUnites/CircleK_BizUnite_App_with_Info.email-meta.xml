    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I received your request for additional information on our Circle K Fuel Card program for Arizona-area businesses through savings4members™ affiliated associations. Please take a few minutes to look through the accompanying information.

We save you money. Robust fuel rebates every time you fuel up at a Circle K location

We save you time. You’ll enjoy the convenience of a single fueling card program and one, easy-to-read invoice. You can also easily download transaction data from the web right to QuickBooks or Excel each month.

We give you control. Detailed reports show how and where fueling money was spent, so you can account for every penny.

We make it convenient. Your drivers only need to carry one card to fuel at any participating location.You will find a complete list of accepting locations at https://www.circlek.com/store-locator

It’s easy to enroll. Simply complete the attached application form and fax it back to me at {!User.Fax}.

Thank you for your interest in the Circle K Fuel Card program.

Sincerely,
