Good day.



I hope you have been pleased with the WEX fleet card program so far!



I&apos;d like you to consider the advantages of the other WEX programs we provide to complement your fleet account:

WEX Telematics - Secure Mobile Asset Reporting and Tracking using GPS technology to monitor driving behavior.
WEX MasterCard Purchase Log - All the purchasing power of a MasterCard with controls and tools to help you when you need to purchase vehicle service larger than lubricants and quick lubes.
No Cost Road Side Assistance - WEX-Tows is a program that costs you nothing unless you use the service.

I&apos;d welcome the opportunity to speak with you about what WEX Inc. can do for you through one or more of our other products.




Sincerely,
