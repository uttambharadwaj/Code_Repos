Good day.


To self-enroll for online access to your fleet account, please go to bottom of the www.wexonline.com page at the Enroll as New User link and enter your account number [                ]and telephone, name. etc. and you will receive a temporary password and can log-in at that point. Others that need online access can use this same process.



Also please see attached information with video links regarding working with your account online.

I would like to set up some time to do a more in depth review of the WEX Online tool. Can you please send me a time that might work for you?  You are also welcome to call me directly to schedule.
