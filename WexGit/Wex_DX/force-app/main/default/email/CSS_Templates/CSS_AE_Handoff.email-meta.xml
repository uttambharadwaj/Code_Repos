Hello.



Congratulations on your recent WEX account approval! Welcome!  I would like to take a minute to introduce myself as your implementation contact as we get your account set up. I will be working with you over the next several days to gather fleet information and make sure your fleet cards are implemented exactly how you want them to be.


·         Once you are set up and have cards in hand I will then introduce you to your new Account Executive.

·         Your Account Executive will be your point of contact at WEX for the duration of your relationship with us. Their objective is to help you get the most value out of your partnership with WEX, bring knowledge to you about other B2B payment solutions, and ensure the success of your program through regular contact.


·         I’ve attached a fleet data form to this email.  If you have not already received this, please go ahead and fill it out and send it back to me at your earliest convenience.

·         If you have any questions at all during your account implementation please reach out me directly.Thanks and I look forward to working with you.





Sincerely,
