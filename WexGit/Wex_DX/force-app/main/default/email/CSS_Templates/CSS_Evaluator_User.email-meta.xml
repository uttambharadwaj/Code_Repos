Hello. Thank you again for choosing WEX to partner with. I am checking with you to see if I could have one of our departments contact you for some feedback on some questions like these:



1.  What motivated you to begin searching for a new fuel card program?

2.  What were the main factors that helped in your decision-making?

3.  What would you do differently, if anything, the next time you go through this process?

4.  Some of the biggest challenges or frustrations you experience with fleet card or vehicle management programs.

5. What interesting fuel/vehicle innovations have you seen recently?



If  you can help with some of these type of questions just let ne know YES and someone will contact you by phone in the near future. If we should contact another person instead please advise who and their telephone. Thank you in advance!

Sincerely,
