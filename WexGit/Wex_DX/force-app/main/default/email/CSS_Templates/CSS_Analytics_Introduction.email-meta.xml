Good day.



I hope you have been pleased with the WEX fleet card program so far!



Are you using or considering using online dashboards to identify items of interest so you don&apos;t need to pour through lines of transactions?



I&apos;d welcome the opportunity to speak with you about what WEX Inc. can do for you to help improve your fleet efficiency.  Can we setup a call with our Analytics coordinator to talk further?
