I want to check in with you and verify that you have received your Universal Fleet Cards. Are there any questions that you have as you prepare to distribute and use the cards?

Attached are a Fuel Policy document and a Fleet Security document that you may find helpful. If there are any questions about the use of the cards or the online features, please call me directly anytime at (207) 523-7615. I am more than happy to assist you in any way I can.


Sincerely,
