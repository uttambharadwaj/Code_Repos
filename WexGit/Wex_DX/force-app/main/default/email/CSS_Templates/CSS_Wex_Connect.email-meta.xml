Good Day!

As you are probably aware, there are various options when choosing a fleet card program. You could look into a branded card offering incentive at that brand. But you may have to burn fuel to get to a specific brand. Another option we suggest is a Universal card program, coupled with a fuel price locator.

WEX provides a free Fuel Site Locator Mobile Application called WEX Connect. This tool allows any phone with internet capabilities to pinpoint a driver&apos;s location and report back the best priced fuel station in a five mile radius. The pricing per gallon information is driven by the more than 1,000,000 transactions per day that WEX processes.

What does this mean to you? Simply put, your fleet drivers could have real time access to the best priced stations, saving you 5 to 25 cents per gallon on every fill up.

We would welcome the opportunity to demo this tool to show you what it can do for your savings related to vehicle fueling. You can contact me through any of the channels listed below.
