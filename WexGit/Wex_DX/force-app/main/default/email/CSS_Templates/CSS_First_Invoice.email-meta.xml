Along with helping get your account implemented, and getting you familiar with WEX-Online, I can also connect with you to go over your first invoice and reports from Online.  My goal is to make sure everything is set up for you accordingly and you are able to take full advantage of all the value that WEX has to offer.


I wish to coordinate our schedules to go over your invoice and reporting if that would be helpful. Please email me or call me at {!User.Phone}.



Sincerely,
