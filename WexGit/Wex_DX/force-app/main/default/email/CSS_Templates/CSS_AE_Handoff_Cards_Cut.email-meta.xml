Hello.



Congratulations on your recent WEX account approval! Welcome!  I would like to thank you for the opportunity to connect as your implementation contact as we got your account set up.



·         Now that you have cards in hand I will then introduce you to your new Account Executive who will be in touch soon.


·         Your Account Executive will be your point of contact at WEX for the duration of your relationship with us. Their objective is to help you get the most value out of your partnership with WEX, bring knowledge to you about other B2B payment solutions, and ensure the success of your program through regular contact.


·         If you have any questions at all during your account implementation please reach out to your Account Executive directly. Thanks and I am glad to have been able to work with you.













Sincerely,
