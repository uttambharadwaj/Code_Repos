Good day.



I hope you have been pleased with the WEX fleet card program so far!

Using WEX Virtual pay, our innovative solution allows you to pay vendors for large service expenses from your desktop. These are just some of the available features:


An easy way to pay your vendors
Digitize your vehicle maintenance payments
Eliminate use of paper checks, plastic cards, manual processes
Provide insight into all payments, by vendor, unit or date
Control spending via security and approval policies for users
Simplify reconciliation by downloading to general ledger

Companies like Orbitz, Expedia, and Priceline are all our customers and use our virtual solution! The attached application can be completed and submitted back to me to begin. Can we setup a call soon to talk further on this option?



Sincerely,
