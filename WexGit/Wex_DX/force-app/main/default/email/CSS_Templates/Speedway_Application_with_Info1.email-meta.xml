    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Attached please see information on our Speedway Business Card Program. Please take a few minutes to look through the accompanying information. I’m confident that you’ll find the widely accepted Speedway Business Card the one-card solution for all your fueling needs.


We save you money. Potential to earn valuable rebates!

We save you time. You’ll enjoy the convenience of a single fueling card program and one, easy-to-read invoice. You can also easily download transaction data from the web right to QuickBooks or Excel each month.

We give you control. Detailed reports show how and where fueling money was spent, so you can account for every penny.

We make it convenient. Your drivers only need to carry one card to fuel at any participating location.


You will find a complete list of accepting locations at www.speedway.com.


It’s easy to enroll. Simply complete the attached application form and scan/email it back to me.

Thank you for your interest in the Speedway Business Card Program.


Sincerely,
