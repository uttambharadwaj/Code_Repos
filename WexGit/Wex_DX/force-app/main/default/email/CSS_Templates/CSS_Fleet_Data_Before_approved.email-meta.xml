Good Day! While your application is being processed, I am reaching out to gather your fleet data.


Attached is a fleet data template with multiple tabs for the information for your cards and drivers. You may already have excel data on hand that provides this information, if so feel free to send that to me as an excel attachment and I will call you to review. Please get this information back to me at your earliest convenience â€“ once I get everything back and credit assigns an account number, we can get your cards shipped!





Sincerely,
