I hope this message finds you well.


I just wanted to check in with you as my latest report shows you have not begun to use your WEX Universal Fleet Cards. Is there something that I can do to help facilitate roll out of the program to your fleet drivers?  As I am sure you are aware, having inactive cards put’s your fleet at risk for fraud.  Additionally, you aren’t able to take advantage of all the cost savings and valuable tools you signed up for!

My main priority is your satisfaction. If there is a problem with the cards or if you have questions about the program itself, please call me directly anytime at {!User.Phone}. I am more than happy to assist you in any way I can.




Sincerely,
