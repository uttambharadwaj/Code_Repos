Good day.



I would like to thank you for using me as your Customer Success Specialist for the last couple months to make sure you are comfortable with online and billing/reporting and additional programs and services we offer as well.



Because you are now proficient with the management of your account, simply contact your assigned support team or WEX Customer Service at 800-492-0669 with your account number for any assistance going forward.



Thank you again and know that Customer Service is well positioned to help on any question you may have related to your account with WEX!
