Good day.



I hope you have been pleased with the WEX fleet card program so far!



Are you using or considering using vehicle tracking for any part of your operation?



I&apos;d welcome the opportunity to speak with you about what WEX Inc. can do for you to help improve vehicle and operator efficiency.  Can we setup a call with our Telematics coordinator to talk further?





Sincerely,
