Thank you for your possible interest in one of our WEX Fleet Card Programs.


I am emailing you to see if your area rep ------  could stop by when in your locale in the next two months. If you have specific dates that are best, please suggest the best time/date over that time period and a summary of your fleet vehicle operation.


We look forward to meeting with you to discuss the benefits of our WEX Fleet Card Programs. I think you will find our programs ideal for your companyâ€™s vehicle fueling needs.


If you have any questions before the meeting, please to do not hesitate to call me at {!User.Phone}.
