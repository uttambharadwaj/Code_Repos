Good Day! First and foremost, welcome to WEX! I will be your Customer Success Specialist for the next 90 days. I will help get your account implemented,  get you familiar with WEX-Online, and make sure you are comfortable with managing the WEX program.  My goal is to make sure everything is set up for you accordingly and you are able to take full advantage of all the value that WEX has to offer.


First things first, to get your cards ready for your fleet, I am attaching a fleet data template with multiple tabs for the information for your cards and drivers. You may already have excel data on hand that provides this information, if so feel free to send that to me as an excel attachment and I will call you to review. Please get this information back to me at your earliest convenience â€“ once I get everything back we can get those cards shipped! The Contact Update Form should be submitted for any account contacts you need to modify from your submitted application.


I look forward to hearing from you and working with you for the next few months! Going forward if you need anything at all, please reach out to me directly.





Sincerely,
