I hope this message finds you well.


I wanted to check in with you regarding the credit line and billing specifics regarding your WEX Universal Fleet Account. Your monthly spend is expected to be ------- and your credit line is --------. Typically the credit line should be 2 1/2 or 3 times the monthly spend to manage normal 26 day billing cycles. If your line is less than that, there are the following options we suggest you select from to operate within the credit line:

Set calendar reminder for mid-month for partial payment
Setup auto-pay monthly or tri-monthly
Use electronic invoice and reports not mailed ones - more time
You can push online payment to checking account instead of mail
Provide additional deposit to increase the credit line

My main priority is your satisfaction and making sure you stay within the credit line on your account. If there is an interest to talk further on this, please call me directly anytime at {!User.Phone}. I am more than happy to assist you in any way I can.




Sincerely,
