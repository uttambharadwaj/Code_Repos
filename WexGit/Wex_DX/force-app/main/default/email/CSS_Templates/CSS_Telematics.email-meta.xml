Good day.


I hope you have been pleased with the WEX fleet card program so far!

Using GPS vehicle tracking and diagnostics, our innovative
solution allows you to get up-to-the-minute reports on the location, speed, and actual operating condition of your vehicles.

These are just some of the available features:

• Vehicle location history
• Engine problem alerts
• In-vehicle display with two-way messaging
• Email alerts for excessive idling, speeding, etc.
• Driver behavior scoring
• Fuel Guard / Fuel Usage

Many of our customers have reported:

• An increase in driver productivity (customers average a 26% increase in productivity)
• A reduction in vehicle fuel consumption (customers average an 11-15% savings in annual fuel costs per vehicle)
• A reduction in overtime paid and automation of remote driver time-cards
• Elimination of unauthorized vehicle use
• Reduction in vehicle repair costs with diagnostic alerts
• Recovery of stolen vehicles and supplies
• A reduction in annual insurance premiums


The primary method that GPS tracking devices can assist companies is through streamlined efficiency of vehicle driving activity. I&apos;d welcome the opportunity to speak with you about what WEX Inc. can do for you to help improve vehicle and operator efficiency. Can we setup a call with our Telematics coordinator to talk further?
