    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I received your request for additional information on our Shell Small Business revolving credit program. Please take a few minutes to look through the accompanying information. You’ll find our widely accepted Shell Small Business is a one-card solution for all your fueling and vehicle servicing needs.

We save you money. Use your Shell Small Business card at any Shell location. This allows you to access stations with the lowest price per gallon.
We save you time. Eliminate manually tracking receipts with the Shell Small Business detailed online reports and add, update and suspend drivers quickly. You’ll enjoy the convenience of a single fueling card program and one, easy-to-read invoice.
We give you control. Take advantage of the real time transaction view and card authorization reports. You can also easily download this data from the web right to Excel each month. Simply find out who, what, where and when the Shell Small Business cards were used by your drivers, so you can account for every penny.
We make it convenient. Your drivers only need to carry one card to fuel at any Shell retail location. You will find a complete list of accepting locations.

It’s easy to enroll. Simply complete the attached application form and fax it back to me at {!User.Fax}.

Thank you for your interest in Shell Small Business.

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
