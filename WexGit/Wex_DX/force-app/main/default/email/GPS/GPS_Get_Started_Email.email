I’ve attached the forms we need you to sign to get started on the GPS system.  The 1st is the Equipment Purchase Plan form.  I need you to:  Fill in a security code at the bottom of page one (last 4 of your Social would be fine), Initial the four X_____ items, fill in bank info for a monthly auto draft for the GPS fee of $8.00/unit, sign and date.  

   The 2nd form is for the recurring monthly service, I need you to sign, print your name, and date at the bottom of pages 2 & 5.  You can add a credit card # & additional signature if you’d like that to be drafted each month.

   The other form is a self-installation waiver form & an installation guide (it is only 3 wires, hot, ground, ignition). 

  Call or email if you have questions.  

Thanks,
