    <subject>WEX Fleet One Fuel Card and 10¢ Off Per Gallon*</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

My name is {!Lead.OwnerFullName}, an Account Executive with Fleet One®.  I attempted to contact you to discuss how Fleet One’s fuel card program can save you time, money and provide you the account security you need.
 
Fleet One saves you time, money and fleet-related headaches with:
• Online Services - You can make changes to your account anywhere you have an internet connection.
• Control - You decide who uses your fuel card, where they may use it and for what products/services.
• Security - Drivers must enter a 4-digit driver ID for authorization for purchases. 
• Reports -  We provide line-item transaction detail on all purchases, available in real-time.
• 10¢  Per Gallon Savings* - We&apos;re offering, for a limited time, 10¢ per gallon rebates for new customers that sign up by December 31st, 2011.

As I mentioned in my message, I look forward to speaking with you personally regarding the specific benefits of Fleet One’s fuel card program and how they relate to your business. 
 
Sincerely,
  
{!User.Name}
