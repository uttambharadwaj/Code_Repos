    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I tried calling you earlier but I was unable to reach you. I am attempting to contact you in regard to accessing our national tire accounts. Aside from fuel, tires are arguably the most sought after discount EDGE customers have available to them at no extra cost.

As a Fleet One EDGE customer, one major benefit is access to our national account tire savings with most major brands, such as Goodyear, Michelin, Continental, Yokohama and more. Available nationwide, you&apos;ll pay the same low price whether you buy over-the-road or at your local dealer. Billing is available right through your Fleet One EDGE card (other payment options also available).

Current customers are already saving an average of $50 per tire. Learn more and request a quote at fleetoneedge.com/gold.

If you decide you would like to utilize our tire pricing, give me a call and I will send you out a price sheet that includes the type of tire(s) you are looking for. You can also just email me back the brand, size, type of tire and I will send you over customized tire pricing.

Thank you,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
