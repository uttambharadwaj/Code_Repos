    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I have attached the necessary paperwork required to move forward. If you are applying for a line of credit, you will need to sign the attached PG form. The other form attached is needed to set up payment from your bank to EFS.

Please sign pages 1,5,7. (must be listed on page 5)

Fill in Tax ID, DOT, MC#, and Date of Birth.

Please include a copy of the owner’s Driver’s License and The Articles of Incorporation (if possible).

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
