{!Account.Name},

Thank you for being a valued customer and your interest in our fuel discount program. We submitted the request to have your EFS/Fleet One account enrolled in the Pilot Flying J discount, administered by TruckersB2B. After review, Pilot Flying J has elected not to authorize the discount through our program. Typically, this is because your company already has a discount in place with them directly or through another program. You may qualify to have your existing discount enabled on this card. To see if you qualify, or if you have additional questions, we encourage you to reach out to Pilot Flying J directly.

Please note that this only applies to the Pilot Flying J discount available through our program. You are still eligible to receive discounts through our other participating merchants. 


Thank you,

TruckersB2B
