I am planning on being in your area next week and was hoping I may be able to chat with you for no longer than 20-25 minutes.  There is a significant opportunity to drive down internal costs by reducing the use of paper checks.  WEX also takes over the onerous task of 1099 reporting in addition to offering a generous rebate program so that you can generate revenue from your payables.  There are no fees to you of any kind.  WEX is a virtual payments pioneer and our sole focus is in this area.  Please let me know if you or a member of your team will be available.  In the meantime, you can learn more about WEX Virtual Payments by visiting our Resource Center.

Thank you and regards,
