    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Have you considered utilizing virtual payments to your AP process to create efficiencies and reduced costs for {!Lead.Company}? I feel that there may be a significant opportunity to reduce your internal costs and I wanted to take this opportunity to say hello.


WEX Inc.(NYSE-WEX) is a commercial bank and MasterCard issuer focused on B2B payments, particularly within the Media Buying, Advertising, Travel and ecommerce verticals.  We specialize in helping accounts payable departments reduce the number of physical checks, ACHâ€™s and wires they issue for payment to their suppliers.  We do this via a unique, single use, electronic transaction.  I am assuming you are paying for a wide range of media and advertising from Google Ads to Television and Radio spots, print ads and many more.  We have many clients who pay these types of vendors with our virtual payment program, they have been able to significantly reduce their costs.  We charge you no fees for this service.


Your company could have an opportunity to streamline its AP process, extend its Days Payable Outstanding while paying its suppliers more quickly and deliver value back to its bottom line.  I am in your area frequently and would love the opportunity to give you a brief, 25-30 minute overview.  No hard selling, no expectations, just a run through of the opportunity and how you may benefit.
