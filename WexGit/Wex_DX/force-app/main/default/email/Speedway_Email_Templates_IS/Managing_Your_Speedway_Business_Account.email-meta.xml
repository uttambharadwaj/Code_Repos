    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Name},

Your cards have shipped and you should receive them in 5-7 business days!

When you receive them you can give me a call if you need help getting set up online.

Our Speedway activation team will also be giving you a call to help you get set-up online,

and answer any other questions about using your cards so look out for another call from a 207 phone number.

Thank you so much for partnering with the Speedway Business Card Program!

Once you receive your cards you can manage your account online! You may opt out of paper statements and avoid a $10 paper statement charge, which is applied to encourage responsible paper usage.
