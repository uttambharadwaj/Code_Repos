    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Greetings from the Speedway Business Fleet Card Program!


We want to let you know that the Speedway station at 1429 State Route 332 in Farmington where your drivers have been fueling is changing hands, and as a result that location will no longer be able to accept the Speedway Business Fleet Card after January 29, 2019.

The good news is that there is another Speedway location less than 2 miles away at 6180 Collett Road where you and your drivers can continue to fuel and enjoy all the benefits of the Speedway Business Fleet Card.

If you have any questions about this change, please contact me directly at the number below.

Thank you for choosing the Speedway Business Fleet Card Program.


Sincerely,
