My name is {!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}; I&apos;m the Regional Sales Manager for the Sunoco Fleet Card Program. A Sunoco Fleet Card can assist you in lowering your fleet fuel costs, and also help significantly cut the amount of time and effort it takes for you to manage your business fleet. Whether you have one company vehicle or more, the Sunoco program can provide you with a new level of control over your vehicle expenses, cutting costs and making your life much easier along the way.

Whether youâ€™re looking for a fleet card program with robust fuel rebates at over 5,000 fueling locations, or nationwide card acceptance for broader fueling convenience, we have the fleet card solution for you.

I will be in your area next week and would like to learn about your current fueling program and needs. Your time is valuable, I realize, so perhaps we can meet just briefly. I&apos;ll be in touch to schedule something, however feel free to contact me directly with a date and time that works well for you.

All my best,
