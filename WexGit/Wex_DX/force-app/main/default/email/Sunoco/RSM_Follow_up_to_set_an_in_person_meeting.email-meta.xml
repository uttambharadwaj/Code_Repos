    <subject>Thank you for your interest in the Sunoco Fleet Card Program.</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I think you’ll find The Sunoco Fleet Card Program to be an ideal solution for your company’s vehicle fueling needs. Whether you’re looking for a fleet card program with robust rebates or nationwide acceptance, Sunoco has a fleet card for you.


Sunoco&apos;s valuable fuel rebate program is just one of the ways you’ll save money as a cardholder. You&apos;ll also be able to leverage our easy, online tools to help your business save time and money.

Powerful Reporting – Know who bought what, when, where and for how much.
Broad Acceptance – Always find a Sunoco fuel site with over 5,000 convenient locations. And if you travel outside of the Sunoco area, our Sunoco Universal Fleet Card is accepted nationwide.
Purchase Controls – Help eliminate any misuse of company vehicles by easily setting purchase limits for individual drivers if needed.
U.S. Based Customer Service – 24/7 assistance for you and your drivers whenever you need it.

I’m confident that your current fleet card provider can’t bring you the breadth of tools that we can. If you have 30 minutes, I&apos;d like to meet in person to discuss what our Program can do for your business.


I will be following up with you next week. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me anytime.


I look forward to talking with you about your needs.


Sincerely,
