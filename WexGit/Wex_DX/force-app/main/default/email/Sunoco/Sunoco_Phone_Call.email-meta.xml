    <textOnly>{!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for taking the time to speak to me today. I think you’ll find the Sunoco Commercial Fleet Card Program an ideal solution for your company’s vehicle fueling needs. Whether you’re looking for a fleet card program with robust rebates or nationwide acceptance, Sunoco has an ideal fuel card for your business.

Sunoco’s valuable fuel rebate program is just one of the ways you’ll save money as a cardholder. My fleet customers have leveraged some of our innovative tools to help their business’ save time and money.

Powerful Reporting – know who bought what, when, where and for how much – available by paper and online, both for FREE!
Broad Acceptance – always find a Sunoco fuel site, with over 5,000 convenient locations; and if you travel outside of the Sunoco area, our Universal Card is accepted nationwide.
Purchase Controls – help eliminate any misuse of company vehicles by easily setting purchase limits for individual drivers if needed.
U.S. Based Customer Service – 24/7 assistance for you and your drivers whenever you need it.

I’m confident that your current fleet card provider can’t bring you the breadth of tools that we can. If you have 30 minutes, we&apos;d like to meet face to face and discuss what Sunoco can do for your business.

I will be following up with you next week. In the meantime, you can reach me at {!User.Phone} or via email at {!User.Email}.

I look forward to meeting with you about the needs of your business.


Sincerely,
