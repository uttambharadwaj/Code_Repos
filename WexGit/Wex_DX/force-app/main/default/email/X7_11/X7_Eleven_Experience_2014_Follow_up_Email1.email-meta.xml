    <subject>IMPORTANT: Increasing Your Store Profits with the 7-Eleven Fleet Card.</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},

With the onset of Spring, I wanted to thank you for visiting our 7-Eleven Fleet Fuel booth at the 7-Eleven Experience in late January. We appreciated the chance to meet and talk with you, and share some details about how the 7-Eleven Fleet Fuel Program can be a powerful tool in increasing your store profitability.

If you sell fuel at your 7-Eleven sites, the opportunities to grow your business through the 7-Eleven Fleet Fuel Program are boundless.

As part of 7-Eleven’s commitment to you, I am here as your dedicated 7-Eleven Fleet Fuel Program Sales Manager to help you generate new and repeat commercial business around your 7-Eleven stores. I want to work with you to identify lead opportunities in your area, bring this business onto the 7-Eleven Universal Fleet Card, and start generating new gallons and c-store spend at your 7-Eleven locations. While this is a win-win for everyone, it’s most importantly a win for you. (Plus you’ll receive $25 for every fleet application that becomes a new, approved account!)

Let’s work together. Feel free to contact me anytime. I’ll also reach out to you to get things started.

Together, we can grow your business.
