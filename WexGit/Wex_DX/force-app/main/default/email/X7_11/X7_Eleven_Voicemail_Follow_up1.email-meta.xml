    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Per my voicemail, I wanted to send along some information about the 7-Eleven Universal Fleet Card Program. I think you’ll find the Program an ideal solution for your business.

Whether you’re looking for robust fuel rebates (up to 5¢ off per gallon, and 7¢ off for your first 11 weeks with our introductory rebate), nationwide card acceptance, or tighter control over your company vehicles, the 7-Eleven Universal Fleet Card is an extremely powerful tool in helping you more easily and cost-effectively manage your fleet of vehicles.

The Program&apos;s suite of online tools are designed to give you complete control over your fleet, including:

 Powerful Reporting. Know who bought what, when, where and for how much – available in hard copy and online.

 Broad Acceptance. Fuel and save at more than 2,600 7-Eleven sites nationwide, with card acceptance at over 90% of all U.S. fueling locations.

 Purchase Controls. Help eliminate any misuse of company vehicles by setting purchase limits for each driver, with purchase alerts to keep you well informed.

 Live U.S.-based Customer Service. Award-winning customer assistance for you and your drivers 24/7.

Please feel free to review the attached Program information and application at your liesure. The application is the first step in getting set up with the Program. If you have any questions, you may contact me anytime. I’ll also plan to follow up with you soon.

I hope we&apos;ll have the opportunity to serve your needs.

Many thanks,
