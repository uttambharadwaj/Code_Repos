    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;m following up in regard to 7-Eleven&apos;s Universal Fleet Card Program. I&apos;m open to discussing/negotiating the details according to your needs, and to win your fleet fueling business.

With 7-Eleven, you&apos;ll receive (among many benefits):

- 7 cents off every gallon purchased at 7-Eleven for your first 11 weeks; then up to 5 cents off per gallon thereafter.
- No set-up or monthly card fees.
- Acceptance at more than 90% of U.S. fueling locations.
- Exceptional online cost and vehicle management controls, including driver purchasing policies to control who makes purchases, where, for what and for how much.
- Detailed purchase and vehicle performance data.
- Comprehensive reporting.

Please let me know if you have 10-15 minutes this or next week to discuss things further. I think you&apos;ll find 7-Eleven&apos;s program a valuable asset to your business.

Thank you in advance for your time.
