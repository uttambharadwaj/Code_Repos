    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks again for your interest in the 7-Eleven Universal Fleet Card Program, and for taking the time to talk with me.

I think you’ll find the 7-Eleven Universal Fleet Card Program an ideal solution for your business, helping you more cost-effectively manage your fleet of vehicles. Whether you’re looking for a fleet card program with robust rebates – up to 5¢ off per gallon, and 7¢ off per gallon for your first 11 weeks with our introductory rebate – or nationwide card acceptance, 7-Eleven’s Fleet Card is a powerful tool.

As we discussed, our program also includes a suite of online tools to help you save hours of administrative time and significantly drive down your fleet costs, including:

 Powerful Reporting. Know who bought what, when, where and for how much – available in hard copy and online.

 Broad Acceptance. Fuel and save at more than 2,600 7-Eleven sites nationwide, with card acceptance at over 90% of all U.S. fueling locations.

 Purchase Controls. Help eliminate any misuse of company vehicles by setting purchase limits for each driver, with purchase alerts to keep you well informed.

 Live U.S.-based Customer Service. Award-winning customer assistance for you and your drivers 24/7.

As promised, I am passing along some helpful Program information and an application. The application is the first step in getting you set up with the 7-Eleven Card. Feel free to contact me with any questions you may have as you review these details. I’ll also plan to follow up with you soon.

Thanks again for your time. We’ll look forward to working with you.
