<![CDATA[Dear {!Contact.FirstName},<br><br><font face="arial">I just wanted to take a moment to introduce myself, my name is Steve Kaye and I'm the Regional Manager for the Esso Fuel Card program in Ontario.&nbsp; I've recently become aware that we have reached out to you regarding our program to some degree.&nbsp; I specialize in working with Executives and by comparison, see if we can add any value to their current fueling methods or provide any needs they aren't receiving at the moment.&nbsp; I'm not here to push our program on to you or waste your time.&nbsp; If what you have is working for you from top to bottom, i'll be the first to tell you to stay with what you have. In reality, you are purchasing fuel with or without Esso, all i'm doing is seeing if the process can be improved upon.&nbsp; In most cases, Executives admit to something they would change or prefer with their current program if they had the choice.&nbsp; In a lot of cases, companies have been status quo for so long, they don't realize the benefits and advantages they could be receiving.&nbsp; Whether it be increased flexibility, more convenience, improved efficiency, heightened security, and more times than not, significant cent per liter savings! We provide all of the above at <b>zero</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;cost to the company, aside from the fuel they purchase! Either way, I'm hoping we can have a conversation to see if there is value we can provide you giving us the opportunity to partner with you. And if not, at least you know were are a phone call away if things change for you!</font><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">I really do appreciate your time in advance and hope to hear from you!&nbsp;</font></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Regards,</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br></span></div><b>{!User.Name}</b> | {!User.Title}<br>Phone: {!User.Phone} |<br>{!User.Email}<br><br>&nbsp; <br><font size="1">Esso Business Card Services, PO Box 41023 STN BRM B, Toronto ON M7Y 7H3</font><br>]]></td>
