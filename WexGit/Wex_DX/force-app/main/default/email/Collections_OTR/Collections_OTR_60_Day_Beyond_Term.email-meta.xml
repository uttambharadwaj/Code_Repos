Dear {!Case.Contact}:


Your reply is requested. Your fuel account has now reached a serious level of delinquency for the following invoices.


NOTE: If your account does go more than 3 invoice cycles outstanding it will require a Credit Review. As an outcome of that review, more restrictive terms may be required.


We want to work with you to avoid further delinquency and escalation of your account.


Please ACT NOW and make a payment today.


Online and Check-by-Phone payments made before 3:30EST will post same day.


We also accept ACH, Wire, or Western Union payments and have a separate Overnight address if you are mailing a physical check.


If you cannot make a payment please respond to this email or call today.
