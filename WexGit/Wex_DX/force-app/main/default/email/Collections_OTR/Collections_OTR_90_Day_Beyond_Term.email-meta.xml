{!Account.BillingAddress}

Dear {!Case.Contact}:

Your urgent reply is required. Your fuel account is significantly past due and needs payment to avoid any risk of further escalation.


We strongly encourage you to pay the full past due balance to bring the account current.


NOTE: Your account is now at risk of escalation to 3rd party collections.


We want to work with you to avoid further delinquency and escalation of your account


If youâ€™re not able to pay the balance in full at this time, please consider paying the oldest invoice to avoid 3rd party collections, or call in to request a weekly payment arrangement.


Make a Payment TODAY


Online and Check-by-Phone payments made before 3:30EST will post same day.


We also accept ACH, Wire, or Western Union payments and have a separate Overnight address if you are mailing a physical check.


If you cannot make a payment please respond to this email or call today.
