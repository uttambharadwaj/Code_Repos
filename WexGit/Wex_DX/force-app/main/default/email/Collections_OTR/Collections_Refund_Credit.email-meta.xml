Dear Customer,


We are completing a periodic review of your account and have discovered a credit that should be returned to you. Please give us a call to make arrangements for refunding this credit or let us know via e-mail if you would like it returned via ACH or check.


If you would like an ACH transfer, please provide a voided check to us so we can return the funds. If we already have your banking information, please confirm the banking institution and the last 4 digits of the bank account we have on file. If you would like the amount returned by check, please send a request to us with the current company address details.


Regards,

EFS Collections and Receivables
