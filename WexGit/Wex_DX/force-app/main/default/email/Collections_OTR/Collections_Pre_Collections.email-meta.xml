Dear Customer,


The above noted account balance remains past due. We have offered you every opportunity to make a satisfactory arrangement to pay your delinquent account.


Collection agents are engaged to handle our delinquent accounts, and we will instruct them to take immediate and appropriate action to enforce settlement unless the amount of {!Case.Rollup_Total_Balance_Due_on_Account__c} is paid.



In the event of legal action, you may be obligated to pay the amount of the claim, late payment charges, and all court costs involved.


If your payment has been sent, please call the number below to update our records.


Regards,
