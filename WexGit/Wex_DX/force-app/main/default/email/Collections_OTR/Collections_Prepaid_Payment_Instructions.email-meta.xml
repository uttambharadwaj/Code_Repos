Dear Customer,


In order to fund your account you may make payments either wire, ACH, or Western Union. Wire payments must be received by 4:00 PM MST in order for those funds to be available that day. ACH payments will not be applied to the account until the following business day.


IMPORTANT:
WIRE PAYMENTS of less than $2,500.00 will be charged an inbound bank fee of $5.00. Additionally, if the Customer # as indicated below is not included, a $15.00 manual application fee will be assessed. All Western Union payments will be charged a $20.00 fee regardless of the amount.
When sending funds, please include your Account#: {!Account.Carrier_ID__c} as an addendum so that your funds may be more quickly applied to your account. Below are the instruction for bank wires:
