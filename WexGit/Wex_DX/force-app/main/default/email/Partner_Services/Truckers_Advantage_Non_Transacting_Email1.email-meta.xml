Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I am following up regarding your Truckers Advantage fuel card through Fleet One and OOIDA. I noticed that you have not been using the fuel card and was curious why. Do you need a little help getting started, or are there any questions I can answer? 

As a reminder, you could be saving 10 cents per gallon at all Pilot and Flying J locations, as well as 6 cents per gallon at Speedway and Quick Fuel locations. On top of that, you enjoy zero transaction fees and 5X MyRewards points at Pilot.

Please let me know if I can be of any assistance. I look forward to hearing from you. 

 

Sincerely,


{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
