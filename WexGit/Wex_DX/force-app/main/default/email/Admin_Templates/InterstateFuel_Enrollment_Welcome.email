Thank you for submitting your request to join Triumph Business Capital's Fuel Discount Card program.  You can save on diesel purchased at Pilot, Flying J, TA/Petro, and other truck stop locations throughout North America.

We have processed your request and will receive notification on your eligibility from our fuel vendors within the next 1 to 4 days.  If you are approved, your point of sale discount will begin to be reflected on your fuel card invoice within two business days from the day you enroll.  The discount will appear on your fuel card transaction report or invoice, not on the receipt you get at the truck stop.    

We truly appreciate the opportunity to work with you  -- and we also appreciate your referrals. If you refer a fleet owner (or two or three!), you will receive a check from us for $500 to $1000 to show our appreciation.  Plus, the businesses you refer will benefit from a no-fuss, no-debt cash flow solution that can get them on the road to success.

Thank you
