Thank you for taking the time to return your fuel discount enrollment form. By enrolling in the TruckersB2B Fuel Discount Program, you are eligible not only for our fuel discounts but also other products and services.

We have processed your fuel form and will receive notification within the next 1-4 days from our fuel vendors on your eligibility.  If you are approved by our fuel stop providers, your point of sale discount will begin reflecting on your billing card invoice within approximately 2 business days from the day you enroll.  The discount will appear on your fuel card transaction report or invoice, not the actual fuel pump receipt.    

We appreciate your business, and also appreciate your referrals.  Help other fleets like yourself save on fuel and many other products or services.   

Thank you,
Jennifer Nelson
