<![CDATA[To: All Wright Express Salesforce.com Users<br><br>This past Saturday, June 2, our Salesforce.com instance was converted to allow support for multiple currencies (MC).&nbsp; The important things you need to know are:<br><br>* Any existing currency values are assumed to be in US Dollars (USD).&nbsp; We have added UK Sterling (GBP) and the Euro (EUR) as additional currencies at this time.<br><br>* You now have a Currency option in Setup | Personal Information which you may Edit and set to determine the currency for converted amounts. Switching that default will change the currency for converted amounts real time as you view or report on records.<br><br>* All currency fields in SFDC will now display with the ISO code of the currency preceding the number. For example, $100 will display as USD 100.<br><br>* Currencies displayed are automatically updated when conversion rates change; we will be updating the rates on the first of every month.<br><br>* Primary currency will show up as before but now an additional value in parentheses will show the converted amount in the secondary currency. The primary currency will be the corporate default currency (USD) unless overridden per record using fields such as Account Currency, Opportunity Currency, etc. The (converted) amount shown is always your personal default currency. Please note, the fields Account Currency and Opportunity Currency are only available in [New] and [Edit] mode.<br><br>* Objects with converted currency fields include Opportunities, Opportunity Products, Opportunity Product Schedules, Campaign Opportunity fields, and reports related to these objects and fields.&nbsp; MC fields are on these page layouts by default.<br><br>* By default only the current exchange rate settings in SFDC are used for converting ALL amounts; change an exchange rate, and all records, even closed Opportunities will show updated converted amount for secondary currency. However, we have enabled Advanced Currency Management. ACM allows maintaining of a list of exchange rates and which date ranges they apply to. Converted "Amount" field on Opportunity - regardless of stage - will display based on exchange rate for the given Close Date. Changing the Close Date will impact (converted) amounts if it changes to a different exchange rate period.&nbsp; NOTE: Dated exchange rates are not used in forecasting, currency fields in other objects, or currency fields in other types of reports; they are ONLY used for Amount fields on Opportunity records.<br><br>* Opportunity records now have new standard required picklist field called Opportunity Currency visible only in the New and Edit modes. The selected currency for each Opportunity is used for the primary amount field.<br><br>* Reports will now show primary amounts per the Opportunity currency for each included record. Reports will show converted amounts in the currency of the user running the report OR the currency set using the picklist in the bottom of the report criteria page.<br><br>* Here is additional information on the implementation of this feature:&nbsp; <a href="https://na1.salesforce.com/help/doc/en/salesforce_using_multiple_currencies.pdf">https://na1.salesforce.com/help/doc/en/salesforce_using_multiple_currencies.pdf<br></a><br>We hope you will find this new feature helpful.&nbsp; Please address any questions to <a href="mailto:Salesforce_Support@wrightexpress.com">Salesforce_Support@wrightexpress.com</a>.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>The WEX Salesforce.com Admin Team]]></td>
