    <subject>IMPORTANT: Significant Fleet Fuel Savings from 7-Eleven</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

My name is Tracy Suh and I&apos;m the Regional Sales Manager for the 7-Eleven Universal Fleet Card Program.

We help businesses like yours save upwards of 15% on overall vehicle management costs, including a competitive rebate of up to 5 cents off per gallon every time you fuel at 7-Eleven. New customers also benefit from our introductory rebate offer of 7 cents off per gallon for the first 11 weeks.

Whether youâ€™re looking for a fleet card program with robust rebates at over 2,600 fueling locations, nationwide card acceptance, or tighter control over your company vehicles, the 7-Eleven Universal Fleet Card is an extremely effective tool in helping you cut costs and save time.

I&apos;ll be in your area next week and would like to speak with you to learn about your current fuel program, and share some additional information about 7-Eleven&apos;s. I&apos;ll call to schedule a time. We&apos;ll keep the meeting short.

Many thanks,

Tracy Suh
