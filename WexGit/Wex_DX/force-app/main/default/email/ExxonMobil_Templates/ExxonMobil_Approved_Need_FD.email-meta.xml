    <textOnly>Dear ,



Good news -- your application has been approved for a $____ monthly credit line!



We just need your fleet data info so we know how many cards to send and how you&apos;d like the account set up. A separate email has been sent to you to do so. 



Once this is completed we will print and ship your cards within 1-2 days. Give them 7-10 days for shipping. The packet will include your account number and other info. 



I&apos;ve attached a document with links to some helpful tutorials on how to manage and navigate your online account so please take a look!




Sincerely,
