    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},

I saw that you received the &quot;whistle&quot; invitation I sent you and visited your personalized web page. I have made several attempts to reach you but haven&apos;t been able to so I thought I would try via email in case that works better for you.

I&apos;d love to have a few moments of your time to show you how you can save money by reducing the cost of managing your fleet of vehicles. I&apos;d like to show you how to save every month on fuel expenses. I also have an attractive introductory offer to share with you.

If you are interested in hearing more, please give me a call back at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
