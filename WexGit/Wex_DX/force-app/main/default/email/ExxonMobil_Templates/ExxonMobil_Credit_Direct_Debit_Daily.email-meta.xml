    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Congratulations! You have been approved for our Direct Debit Program on your ExxonMobil Fleet Card.


With this plan, we simply debit your fleet program balance directly from your checking account daily for the previous dayâ€™s transactions.


You will need to complete the attached form to get set up on Direct Debit. Please take a few moments to fill this out and then either scan/email it to me at the email address noted below or fax it back to me at {!User.Fax}. Please be sure to include a voided check.

Once I receive the completed form, I will call you to verify the setup of your account prior to issuing your cards. Meanwhile, please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Thank you for choosing the ExxonMobil Fleet Card Program.

Sincerely,



{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
