I've been asked to reach out to Customers to offer assistance and support with maintaining compliance with the latest FMSCA requirements, such as the electronic log mandate. This may be a key concern, and the deadline for compliance is quickly approaching. Who is the best person for me to speak with there who is the most knowledgeable of your fleet vehicles and equipment?
