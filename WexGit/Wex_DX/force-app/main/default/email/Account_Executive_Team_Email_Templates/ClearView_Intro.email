Dear {!Contact.Name}

I hope you are off to a good start in 2016. I’ve recently learned that your account is eligible to utilize our new data analytics platform and that it’s already integrated into your existing WEX Fleet Card program. ClearView helps our customers bring their analysis and decision-making to new levels without the time-consuming, manual calculations and help you get at info more quickly than you can today.

ClearView gives you a dynamic view into your fleet operations. You'll have the ability to combine and analyze large amounts of data, and use the results to take corrective action. Clearview users get an understanding of short and long-term trends, reviewing performance benchmarks and isolate outliers and anomalies like fuel and non-fuel spends that fall outside the norm. All this can be viewed in aggregate for your entire organization, or for a specific part of your business, for example, a division or location.


I’d love to walk you through how this works and how easy the platform is to navigate. When would be an okay time for us to connect?

Regards,
