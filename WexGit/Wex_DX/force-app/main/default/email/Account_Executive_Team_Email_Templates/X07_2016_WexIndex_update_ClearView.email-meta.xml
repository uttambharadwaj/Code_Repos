    <subject>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; Your WEX Fleet Fuel Savings Update &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName} -

How&apos;s everything going? I have updated information for you on fuel price trends and your fleet card account.

Fuel prices will likely continue declining for the next couple of weeks and stay low for the remainder of the year. You can get more fuel price trend information from WEX online at http://www.wexinc.com/our-story/wex-index/.

I&apos;ve attached your latest account review workbook along with some fuel price information for you.

These are the areas where your fleet card fueling data shows as cost savings opportunities or where you may already be sustaining cost avoidance:

Thanks for being a WEX Customer.

Kind Regards,

Kevin Thompson
