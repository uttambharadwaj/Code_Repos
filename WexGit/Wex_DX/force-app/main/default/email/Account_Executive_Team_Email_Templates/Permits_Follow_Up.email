I’m always trying to keep an eye out on how you can save money, and last we spoke you mentioned you need to buy permits. 

I strongly recommend you try our permitting service. We’re the low cost provider, plus your first permit is free. I’ve attached some information with the pricing terms included. You should get this to whoever manages permit ordering today, or just go to our website https://www.fleetonepermits.com/ next time permits need to be ordered to get started. They can register and order permits online with a credit card, or get an additional $3 off per permit if you have it billed to a WEX Fleet One account invoice.
