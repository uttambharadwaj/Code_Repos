    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName}



Hope all is well! It&apos;s time for us to schedule your account review for your WEX fuel card program. I am excited to bring you up to speed on our latest program developments, and to talk about what opportunities we see to help you cut your company&apos;s fuel costs. I&apos;d also like to get up to speed with any new needs, goals, and company initiatives you may have.  Additionally, I wanted to let you know that WEX has converted its global workforce to working from home amid concerns of COVID-19. We have the resources and technology to continue providing uninterrupted support to you and all Customers. I&apos;ve attached our corporate response.


When would be an okay date and time to schedule and discuss your needs, goals, and savings opportunities?



Thanks,
