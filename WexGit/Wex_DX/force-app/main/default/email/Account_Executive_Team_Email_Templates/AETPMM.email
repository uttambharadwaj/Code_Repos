Hi {!Contact.FirstName} -

I am a consultant here at WEX, your long-time fuel card provider.  It came to my attention that your account has yet to receive a complimentary savings consultation and I wanted to reach out to offer my services.   We greatly appreciate your business and understand the continual pressures you are under to reduce costs.  

Most customers think of WEX as a fuel card provider, but that is just one of the solutions we offer to save your company time and money.  As a strategic consultant, I am here as a resource to review your current fuel and purchasing methods and uncover opportunities to lower your costs and potentially add revenue back to your bottom line.  With all of our recent acquisitions, developments, and partnerships in consideration, I want to perform a needs analysis to confirm if your current program is still the best fit and to see if you now qualify for any financial incentives. To do this I just need to ask you a few questions, and I only need about 15 minutes of your time.

Please let me know when we can schedule a brief call.
