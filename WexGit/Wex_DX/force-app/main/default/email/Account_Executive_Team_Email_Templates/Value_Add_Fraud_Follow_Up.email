Hi {!Contact.FirstName} - 

A few weeks ago I emailed you about seeing an increase in fraud incidents related to pay-at-the-pump skimming scams, and offered time to schedule a call to review and discuss your controls in place to help you ensure you have optimum protection. You hadn't responded, so I wanted to extend the invitation to you again, and have also attached our latest document published regarding fleet card fraud. Please see attached, and please let me know an okay time to schedule a call.
