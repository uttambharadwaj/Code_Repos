    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName} –

This is {!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName} from WEX, your fuel card provider. Thank you for your business. I&apos;ve recently been assigned as your new, dedicated Account Executive, and I&apos;m here to help you get the most value from existing and new WEX solutions. Fuel prices recently hit a four year high, and card fraud is on the rise. Many are looking for other ways to save money to offset the impact. I wanted to introduce myself, and let you know that I’ll be reviewing your fueling data closely to uncover some helpful cost savings opportunities for you. I’ll aim to follow up with you early next week, but please feel free to reach out to me in the meantime should you need anything. If you would like to spend 15 minutes to review the details with me, please feel free to send me a date and time to do so. My contact information is below.

Kind Regards,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
Account Executive

P.S. -- With summer fuel prices recently hitting a 4 year high and with hurricane season around the corner, it&apos;s a good idea to remind everyone to use our free mobile app WEX Connect.
