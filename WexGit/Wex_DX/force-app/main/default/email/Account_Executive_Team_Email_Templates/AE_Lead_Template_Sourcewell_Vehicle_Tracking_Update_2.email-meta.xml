    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName} â€“

I hope you had a great weekend.  Did you get the email I sent last week?  Just sending a reminder about the opportunity to schedule a discovery call related to our Sourcewell GPS Telematics to see what fits your organization&apos;s needs and budget.  Please let me know if you are interested or if there is a different person I should connect with.  I look forward to speaking with you.

Thanks,
