Hello {!Contact.FirstName} - 

I hope all is well with you! Thanks for using your {!Account.Affinity_Cobrand_Sub_Interest__c} Fleet Card program by WEX for your fuel purchasing needs. What makes your program unique and better than other programs out there is our robust fuel transaction & vehicle analysis reports. We also give you the access to nearly all fueling locations, but it's all within our secure, closed-loop network.

While other providers may only allow you to restrict merchant types, with your cards you can restrict actual product types, and limit dollars, gallons, and transactions by day of the week and even by hour of the day. Here what fleet managers have to say about how helpful our controls and reporting are:

We've seen an increase in fraud incidents related to pay-at-the-pump skimming scams, and Iâ€™m happy to schedule time with you to help you ensure your controls are configured for optimum protection. Just let me know an okay time to schedule and discuss.
