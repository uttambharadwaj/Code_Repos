Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

As a strategic partner of WEX Inc. we are always looking for ways we can help your company reduce costs.

American Payroll Association sites, on average the cost to cut a paper check is $3-$10 each pay period per employee.

Are you currently cutting paper checks for your payroll?

Thanks,
