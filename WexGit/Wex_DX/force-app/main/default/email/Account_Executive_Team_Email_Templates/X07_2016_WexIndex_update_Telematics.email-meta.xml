    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName} -

How&apos;s everything going? I have updated information for you on fuel price trends and your fleet card account.

The summer driving season hasn’t even begun and there are many that believe the gasoline markets may have already peaked. You can get more fuel price trend information from WEX online at http://www.wexinc.com/our-story/wex-index/.
