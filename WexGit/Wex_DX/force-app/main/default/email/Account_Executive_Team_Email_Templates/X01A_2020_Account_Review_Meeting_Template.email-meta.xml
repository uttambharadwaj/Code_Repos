    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName}



Hope all is well! It&apos;s time for us to schedule your account review for your WEX fuel card program. I am excited to bring you up to speed on our latest program developments, and to talk about what opportunities we see to help you cut your company&apos;s fuel costs. I&apos;d also like to get up to speed with any new needs, goals, and company initiatives you may have.


When would be an okay date and time to schedule and discuss?



Thanks,
