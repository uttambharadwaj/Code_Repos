We're not far from the time of year where many will be scrambling to complete 1099 tax reporting on appropriate vendors. WEX Customers can avoid all of that work simply by using our purchasing card or virtual payment solution to pay their vendors instead of using paper check or ACH. By paying vendors with our program, the IRS puts the reporting responsibility on the merchant bank instead of the buyer (http://www.irs.gov/uac/Payment-Card-Transactions-FAQs). Let's have a call to discuss. When would be an okay time to connect with you?
