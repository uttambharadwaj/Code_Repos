Hi -

 

This is {!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName} from WEX, your fleet fuel card provider. Thank you for your business. You may recall an email and/or got a phone call from me about the GPS/Telematic options available to you as a WEX and NJPA member (Now Sourcewell).  I apologize if this message is delayed, its been very busy with ELD reuqirements. If your organization is planning to search for a provider this year, we offer this discovery call opportunity to see the solutions and savings available.  Many find it a great way to evaluate and make sure they get the best services and solutions needed at the best prices.  Let me know when it would be a good date and time to place you on the calendar for a call?

 

Best Regards,
