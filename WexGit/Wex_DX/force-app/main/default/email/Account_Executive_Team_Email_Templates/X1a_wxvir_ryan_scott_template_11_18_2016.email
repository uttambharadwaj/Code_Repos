Good Morning {!Contact.FirstName},

We were looking at your monthly usage on the fleet cards and you seem to have a significant amount of unused credit available on your account.  That is not a bad thing and we arenâ€™t looking to reduce your credit line but we think it would make a lot of sense to move a portion of it over to our complimentary MasterCard program.  Since the credit is already there, the enrollment process is quick and simple.  Many of our customers are using the MasterCard program in conjunction with the fuel card to get a wider acceptance when it comes to things link vehicle maintenance, travel or vendor payments.  

I would like to setup a time to have a quick discussion with you about the program.  What would be an okay day/time to contact you?

Thank You!  We appreciate your business!
