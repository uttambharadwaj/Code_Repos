I just read this, and am sharing it with all of my friends in Florida.

In credit card skimming schemes, thieves use a device to steal credit card information in an otherwise legitimate credit or debit card transaction. For example, credit card skimming devices are often placed over card readers on fuel pumps or even held in the hands of waiters and store employees. When a credit card is run through a skimmer, the device stores the credit card information. Thieves use the stolen data to make fraudulent charges either online or with a counterfeit credit card. In the case of ATM and debit cards, thieves withdraw cash from the linked checking account. Credit card skimmers are even popping up on Redbox movie rental kiosks.
