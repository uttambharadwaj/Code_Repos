    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName} –


Summer is upon us.


We are excited to bring you up to speed on our program enhancements that we will be rolling out this year. I would also like to review your WEX fuel card account with you for areas we have identified to help reduce your fuel costs and discuss any fleet management related company initiatives you have.


Please let me know an okay day and time to schedule and discuss.  My contact information is below.


Kind Regards,
