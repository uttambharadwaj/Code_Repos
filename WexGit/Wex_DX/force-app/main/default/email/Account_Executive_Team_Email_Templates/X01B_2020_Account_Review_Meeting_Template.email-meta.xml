    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName}


Hope all is well! It&apos;s time for us to schedule your account review for your WEX fuel card program. I&apos;d like to talk about what opportunities we see to help you cut your company&apos;s fuel costs, and to get up to speed with any new needs, goals, and company initiatives you may have. I am also excited to bring you up to speed on our latest program developments and solutions like

路 Telematics

路 Fleet Data Analytics

路 Corporate Card and Virtual Payment Solutions

路 New Onsite Fuel Delivery Option


When would be an okay date and time to schedule and discuss?



Thanks,
