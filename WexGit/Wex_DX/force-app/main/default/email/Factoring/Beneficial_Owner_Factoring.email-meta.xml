    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for taking the time to discuss your Fleet One Factoring application with me today.

Once you’ve completed the attached form, please email it back to me at my email address listed below in order for WEX Bank to continue processing your application.

Again, thank you for your interest in Fleet One Factoring. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.
