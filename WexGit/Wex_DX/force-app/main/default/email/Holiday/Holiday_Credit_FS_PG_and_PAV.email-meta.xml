    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing the Holiday Fleet Card Program.

In order to qualify for credit, you may either submit financial statements for your business or have an officer of the company sign a Personal Guaranty (attached).

If you choose to send financial statements, you will need to send one full year of financial records. This consists of your balance sheet and income statement.

For the Personal Guaranty, an officer of the company must complete and sign the form. Once completed, you can either scan/email it to me at the email address noted below or fax the guaranty to me at {!User.Fax} .

Also, to comply with the Patriot Act, our bank needs you to verify your physical address for approval.  Please provide documentation from a third party to verify your business is located at the correct address listed on your application.

To pass verification, the bank requires a copy of one of the following documents:


Utility bill or insurance document showing that the bill is mailed to the physical street address or that it services the physical address of the business
Lease agreement which identifies the business and the physical address of the office
Certified articles of incorporation
An unexpired government-issued business license.


Feel free to scan and email the verification to me at the email address noted below, or if you prefer, you can fax it to me at {!User.Fax}.  You can also call me at {!User.Phone} if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
{!User.Title}
Phone - {!User.Phone}

Fax - {!User.Fax}
