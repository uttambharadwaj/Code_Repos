The FTS fuel card gives you access to premium fuel discounts at more than 1,900 locations nationwide, including all major chains. For small and medium sized trucking companies, the FTS discount program is an open door to lower fuel costs and purchasing fees, keeping drivers satisfied, and most importantly- improving your bottom line.

To see all the FTS Plus+ benefits, visit http://ftsplus.com. 

As an FTS card holder, you are also automatically enrolled in FTS Plus+, a free benefits program that provides savings on everything needed to run your business, including new and used trucks, tires, maintenance, wireless services and so much more. The savings go right back on your fuel card.

I would love to the opportunity to tell you more about how the FTS fuel card can help your fleet. Please give me a call at 800.749.1724 ext. 2, or email me at info@ftsplus.com.



Thank you,
