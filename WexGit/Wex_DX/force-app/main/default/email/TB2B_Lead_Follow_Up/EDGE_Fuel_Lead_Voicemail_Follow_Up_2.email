{!Lead.FirstName},

I'm still trying to connect with you regarding your recent request for more information on the Fleet One EDGE fuel card. I'm confident our fuel card can give your fleet a real edge.

As a reminder, the Fleet One EDGE card offers the most extensive and comprehensive fuel discount network available. Get fuel discounts at over 3,600 sites with average savings of 15 cents per gallon* and no fuel transaction fees in the EDGE network**. Plus access to thousands of additional savings, including tires, maintenance, wireless and much more.  

Please give me a call back at {!User.Phone}, or reply to this email to get the ball rolling. If I don't hear back from you today, I will attempt to connect with you tomorrow.

Thanks,
