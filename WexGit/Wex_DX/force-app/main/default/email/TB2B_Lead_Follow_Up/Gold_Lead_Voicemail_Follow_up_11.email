{!Contact.FirstName},

I just tried calling, but I wanted to send you a quick email in case this is more convenient for you. I'm following up on your recent interest in our  savings. 

I'd love to go over our program and savings in detail with you and see how we can help. 

Feel free to give me a call back or reply to this email at your earliest convenience, otherwise I will try you back tomorrow. 

Thank you, and I look forward to helping your fleet.
