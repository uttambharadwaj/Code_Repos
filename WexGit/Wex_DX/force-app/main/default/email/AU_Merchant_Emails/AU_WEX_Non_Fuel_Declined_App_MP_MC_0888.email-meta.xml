    <subject>Update on your Motorpass and Motorcharge application</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}



Thank you for you recent application to become a Motorpass and Motorcharge merchant.


We are currently undertaking a review of our merchant network in a number of areas, including the Parts and Accessories category.  the purposes of the review are:


To better understand our customer&apos;s needs and desires around products/service, convenience and value; and

To deliver better outcomes for our customer&apos;s, merchants and our business.


The review may result in an addition, reduction or remain unchanged the number of merchants in the category.


Therefore pending the outcome of the review, we are placing all new merchant applications on hold.


Whilst I appreciate this decision may be disappointing, I am happy to keep your details on file and contact you should we wish to proceed with the application further.


Thank you for your understanding.



Sincerely,


Tracey Vines


Merchant Support Manager
