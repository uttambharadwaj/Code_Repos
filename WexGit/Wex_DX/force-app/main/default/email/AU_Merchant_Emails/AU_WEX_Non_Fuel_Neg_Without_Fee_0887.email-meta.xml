    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}



Thank you for your interest in joining WEX Australia Pty Ltd national network of merchants.


More and more Australian businesses are choosing Motorpass, Australia&apos;s premier fleet cards, to manage their vehicle related expenses. As a merchant of our network you will enjoy access to almost 145,000 cardholders nationally who use Motorpass for fuel, repairs, accommodation, car parking, vehicle rental and taxis.


Once your application has been finalised, you will receive a start-up kit containing stationery, operating procedures, a merchant indentification card, and Motorpass decals.  Make sure that you display the Motorpass symbol prominently, as our research indicates that cardholders&apos; vehicle servicing decisions are heavily influenced by site badging.


Your new merchant number will be activated once we receive your completed application for this merchant facility.  If you are already trading in your business, do not use the Merchant Number of the previous owner.


Please note section M of the form which requires you to nominate a payment plan. This choice determines how quickly you will be paid by us and commission rate applicable.
