    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}



Welcome to the Motorpass merchant network!


Motorpass is increasingly the card of choice for administering vehicle related expenditure among Australian businesses, with almost 145,000 cardholders nationally now using Motorpass for fuel, vehicle repairs, vehicle rental, accommodation and taxis.  Display the Motorpass symbol prominently to ensure passing business does not pass you by!


Your merchant number is on the merchant card enclosed and should be quoted whenever you require authorisation, order stationery or have a query relating to your account.


Please read the enclosed Merchant Operating Guide carefully and ensure that your staff are aware of the documented procedures, particularly those relating to purchase authorization, completing sales vouchers, purchasing restrictions and manual batching.


You will shortly receive a Starter Pack containing the stationery required to process Motorpass transactions.  Please notify us if this is not delivered within 5 working days.


The ability to access important information via our Web Self Service facility is also available to you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Using the Web Self Service you can:

-           access batch/settlement information

-           view and download statements

-           access warning bulletins/hot card lists

-           And more!
