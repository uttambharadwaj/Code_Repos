    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Per my voice mail, I wanted to give you an overview of WEX. I’m sure you’re familiar with WEX, but we’ve evolved since we first created the fleet card market back in 1983.


We now service over 10.3 million vehicles. Our fleet customers have leveraged some of our new innovations to help their business’ save time and money. Here are a few of the top ones:


· http://www.wexinc.com/wex-mobile/octane-fuel-finder-app




· http://www.wexinc.com/fleet-operators-and-managers/gps-vehicle-tracking




· http://www.wexinc.com/wex-fleet-management-demo




Our call center recently ranked #20 in Top 100 US Call Center study, and my new customers coming from competitors have raved about the difference.




I’m confident that your current fleet card provider can’t bring you the breadth of tools that we can. If you have 30 minutes, we&apos;d like to meet face to face and discuss what WEX can do for your business.


I will be following up with you next week. In the meantime, you can reach me at {!User.Phone} or via email at {!User.Email}.


I look forward to meeting with you about the needs of your business.



Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
