Congratulations, your WEX account has been approved.


Before your account can be setup, I will need your driver and vehicle information. Please fill out and email the attached Fleet Information Form back to me as soon as possible. The Customer Vehicle ID information you provide will appear on the second line of your cards, under your company name.


A card will be assigned to each vehicle you list. You can provide Driver ID numbers on the form, or you can let our computer assign them.  Each Driverâ€™s ID will work with any of your vehicle cards.



Again, congratulations on your new WEX account. I look forward to helping you run your business more efficiently. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.


Sincerely,
