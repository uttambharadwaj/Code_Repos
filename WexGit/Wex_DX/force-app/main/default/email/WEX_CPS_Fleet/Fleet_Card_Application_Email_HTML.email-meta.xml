Attached you will find our fleet card application. This application is the first step in getting your fleet account up and running.


Please complete the application and email it to me at {!User.Email}. I will then submit it to our bank, WEX Bank, and we will have a decision on the application in the next 3-5 days.


I look forward to working with you to finalize the setup details as soon as your account is approved.


If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at {!User.Phone}.

Sincerely,
