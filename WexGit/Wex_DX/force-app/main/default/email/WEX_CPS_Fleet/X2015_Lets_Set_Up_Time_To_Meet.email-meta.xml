    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for taking the time to meet with me. I appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your business, and also speak about the features and benefits that WEX Offers. I just wanted to recap why we are different than many other solutions out there:


Over 30 years of payments industry experience
Award-winning 24/7 US-based customer service
Over 350,000 customers
Features including product type controls, 99.8% Level III Data capture, customized reporting, flexible card types, and much more

I&apos;d welcome the opportunity to get you more information in the coming days. In the meantime, I have a series of industry leading white papers at my disposal, including The Fleet Managers Handbook. Its full of cost saving tips. I can email you a copy if you&apos;d like - just let me know.


Thank you again, and lets keep in touch.


Sincerely,


{!User.Name} | Phone: {!User.Phone}
