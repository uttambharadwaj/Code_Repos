Good day!



The State of Florida WEX fleet fuel program may be a great fit for any retail fueling you have or as a backup plan. In some cases we are competitive with bulk private site fueling. You are eligible to participate under this agreement.



Some of the advantages of this agreement are:

Acceptance at more than 8,500 gas stations and over 3,000 vehicles service locations in the State of Florida.
Earn 1.45% off all retail transactions charges to your account. That is about .05 per gallon or more at today&apos;s prices!
Online Account access to control and manage fleet purchases.
Federal taxes exempted at the time of billing and reporting for qualified fleets to significantly reduce administrative time.
Roadside assistance to keep your fleet covered while they are on the road, available 24 hours a day.
Fuel Site Mapping Mobile Application allows your drivers to find the best priced convenient fuel station based on their current location.

Participation is simple! Simply fill out the attached participation agreement and tax documentation forms and email back to me. While WEX is setting up your account in our system, I&apos;ll contact you to go over the fleet data.
