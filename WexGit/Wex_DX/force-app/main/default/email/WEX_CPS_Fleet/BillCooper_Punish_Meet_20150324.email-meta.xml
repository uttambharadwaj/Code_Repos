    <subject>Thank you for taking the time to meet</subject>
    <textOnly>Per my voice mail, I&apos;d love to speak with you about all that WEX offers. We’ve got one of the lowest attrition rates and highest customer satisfaction levels in the industry.
What does that mean for your business? We’ve been doing this since 1983, and service everyone from the U.S. Government to The Orkin Man. Here’s just a sample of what we offer:

•    WEX Fleet: Level III Data, Product Type Controls, and one of the largest acceptance networks
•    WEX Over-The-Road: Acceptance at 7,800 truck stops with NO transaction fees
•    WEX Fuel Advisors: Fuel inventory management

Don’t trust what I tell you — listen to what our customers are saying. Amerigas, Renzenberger, Rollins . . . these fleets rave about us. Hear what they are saying.

I look forward to speaking with you soon. In the meantime, take a look at this white paper on what makes Closed Loop Fleet Cards like WEX different.

And please, don’t hesitate to call me with questions.

Sincerely,

William E. Cooper III
