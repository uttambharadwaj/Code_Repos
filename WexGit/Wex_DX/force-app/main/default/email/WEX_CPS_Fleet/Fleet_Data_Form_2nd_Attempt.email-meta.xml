    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I recently wrote to let you know that your WEX Fuel Card account has been approved, and included Fleet Data forms that required your completion. I have not yet received those forms back from you.

We cannot issue your cards until we have that information in hand. I am including the forms here again for your reference. Please fax these forms back to me at 207-253-1408 at your earliest convenience. Once I receive this information I will be in touch to review the account set up with you before issuing your cards.

Meanwhile, just give me a call with any questions.


Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
