    <subject>WEX Call Center Makes Top 100 Call Center List</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.LastName},



The WEX Customer Service Call Center was recently recognized as one of the top 100 call centers in the U.S. for our level of customer service.


As you are asked to do more with less on almost a daily basis it helps to know the folks standing behind the relationship you rely on to keep your vehicles running can deliver for you, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.


What makes our call center unique is it is located on the same campus as our corporate offices in South Portland, ME. The folks manning the phones are WEX employees, used to dealing with fleet fueling issues, be it you, your driver or a station calling in for assistance or to answer a simple question.


In addition to great services, fleets like Asplundh Tree Experts, the U. S. Federal Government, Enterprise Rent A Car, and AT &amp; T use the WEX card today for the savings they achieve with great tools, data and industry leading purchase controls.


With nearly five million cards outstanding, we are the single largest fuel card provider in the U. S.


I will be calling you in the coming days to see if we can speak further about the benefits of the WEX Universal Fleet Card program. In the meantime, I can be reached at {!Opportunity.OwnerPhone} or by e-mail at {!Opportunity.OwnerEmail}.
