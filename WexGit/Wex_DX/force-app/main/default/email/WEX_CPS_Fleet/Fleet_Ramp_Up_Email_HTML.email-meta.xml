My latest report shows you only using a few of your WEX Universal Fleet Cards. Please let me know what I can do to help facilitate roll out of the program to your fleet drivers.

If there is a problem with the cards or if you have questions about the program itself, please call me at {!User.Phone}.


Sincerely,
