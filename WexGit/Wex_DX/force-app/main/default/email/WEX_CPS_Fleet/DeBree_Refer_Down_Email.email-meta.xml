I have been in contact with MAIN CONTACT NAME HERE and they determined you would be the person I should meet with to review how your company manages fleet operations to see if my company can reduce your costs or help you gain more control over your expenses.


We help organizations like {!Account.Name} with reducing the operating cost of their fleet operation.


Specifically what we do is:


- Provide driver convenience – The WEX Fleet Card is accepted at 9 of 10 US fuel stations.

- Provide control – real time authorization of card and driver ID.

- Give you savings – our tools and controls reduce unauthorized purchases.


Attached are testimonials from a few of our customers show:


- WEX provides the most detailed reporting in the industry.

- WEX Customer Service is unparalleled in the industry.

- WEX customers realize significant cost savings.


I don’t know if we could duplicate these kinds of results with your company, but would it not be interesting to find out?


I look forward to meeting with you.

Sincerely,
