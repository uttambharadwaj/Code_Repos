    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Per my voice mail, I wanted to give you an overview of WEX. I’m sure you’re familiar with WEX, but we’ve evolved since we first created the fleet card market back in 1981.


We now service over 6.6 million vehicles, have a telematics business, and a suite of B2B payment solutions. My fleet customers have leveraged some of our new innovations to help their business’ save time and money. Here are a few of the top ones:


· Fuel Site Locator: Find the best priced fuel stations via our new mobile application.

· Fuel Guard Report: Uncover problems by combining GPS tracking with fuel card transactions.

· Pump Shut-off: Shut off the pump when a driver reaches your pre-set limits… see how it works in this video.

· WEXOnline: Your reporting can be hassle free and efficient… don’t settle for antiquated reporting software. Check out our 5 minute demo.


I realize that you probably get lots of calls from vendors that want your business. Anyone can claim to be better, but you should demand the proof to back it up. Our customers are loyal, which is why we have an extremely low attrition rate. See what our customers are saying about us on YouTube. Our call center recently ranked #20 in Top 100 US Call Center study, and my new customers coming from competitors have raved about the difference.


I’m confident that your current fleet card provider can’t bring you the breadth of tools that we can. If you have 30 minutes, we&apos;d like to meet face to face and discuss what WEX can do for your business.


I will be following up with you next week. In the meantime, you can reach me at {!User.Phone} or via email at {!User.Email}.


I look forward to meeting with you about the needs of your business.



Sincerely,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
