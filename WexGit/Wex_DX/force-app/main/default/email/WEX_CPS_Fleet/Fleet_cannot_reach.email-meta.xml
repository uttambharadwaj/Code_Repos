    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


I have been trying to get in touch with you for an update on your evaluation of WEX. I have not had much luck, so unless I hear otherwise, I will assume you have decided not to move forward with our service.


Let me know if there is anything further I can do. If there is someone else in your organization responsible for this evaluation, please forward this email along -- or let me know and I will follow up accordingly.



Best regards,
