I am wondering if you could give me some advice. We help organizations like {!Account.Name} with reducing the operating cost of their fleet operation.  I don’t know whom I need to speak with to see if we can help you in this area.

This is where I need some help from you.  Who would be the individual (within your organization), if not you, that you would recommend I meet with to look at our services to see if there’s a potential fit?


Specifically what we do is:


- Provide driver convenience – accepted at 9 of 10 US fuel stations.

- Provide control – real time authorization of card and driver ID.

- Give you savings – our tools and controls reduce unauthorized purchases.


Attached are testimonials from a few of our customers show:


- WEX provides the most detailed reporting in the industry.

- WEX Customer Service is unparalleled in the industry.

- WEX customers realize significant cost savings.


I don’t know if we could duplicate these kinds of results with your company, but wouldn’t it be interesting to find out?


I look forward to speaking with you. And, thank you for any advice you can give me.

Sincerely,
