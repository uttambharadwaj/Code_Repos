    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


Have you looked recently at your Fleet Fuel Card Program?

The reasons why fleet and fuel managers are choosing WEX include mitigating risk and growing revenue.

We provide CONTROLS - SECURITY - CONVENIENCE - BEST REPORTING.

I am requesting a meeting on &lt;date&gt; at &lt;time&gt;. If these dates will not work for you please let me know, I would be happy to work with your calendar.

I look forward to hearing from you.
