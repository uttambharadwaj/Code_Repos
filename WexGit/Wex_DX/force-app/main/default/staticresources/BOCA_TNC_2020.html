THE BUSINESS ACCOUNT AGREEMENT, together with the related credit application, documents and schedules (collectively, the “Agreement”) govern the establishment and use of a business charge card account provided by WEX Bank, a federally-insured Utah industrial bank (“Issuer”), to the business identified in the credit application approved by Issuer (“Company”). The definitions on Schedule A apply for purposes of this Agreement.
1. Use of Account.
The Account may be used to make purchases at merchants participating in the WEX network. Company agrees that the Account and a Card may only be used for business purposes, and not for any agricultural or personal, family, or household purposes. Company shall adopt and follow internal policies and controls to ensure that the Accounts and Cards are used strictly for business purposes. Purchases of lottery tickets or other games of chance, gift cards, pre- paid cards or other cash equivalent charges are prohibited.
2. Account Users.
2.1 Company shall designate Account Users as well as those contacts authorized to: (a) provide Issuer with the information necessary to establish and maintain Account(s), Cards, and DINs; (b) provide vehicle, driver and other information; (c) receive all Account numbers, Cards or reports; (d) receive other Account information; and (e) select additional products and/or services that may be offered. Company will provide notice of any change or removal of any contact or Account User either in writing, by telephoning Issuer’s customer service department or through Issuer’s online system. Issuer is authorized to take instruction from any Account User or contact with apparent authority to act on Company’s behalf. Unless Company reports any errors in Account information or Cards, Issuer is entitled to rely on that information for servicing the Account. Company shall ensure that each Account User complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Company is liable for any employee misuse of Cards.
2.2 Company is responsible for notifying Issuer of any revocation of authority of an Account User to use a Card or the Account. An Account User shall be deemed to have authority to use a Card and the Account until Issuer receives notice of revocation of authority from Company in the manner required by Issuer and Issuer has a reasonable time to act on the notice, notwithstanding whether any such use is consistent with any limitations on use imposed on an Account User by Issuer.
2.3 Company assumes all risk if Company chooses to leave a Card at an accepting location for use by its drivers or Account Users and, as such, agrees to pay for all charges made with that Card or on that Account. Company agrees to keep DINs confidential and ensure that its employees or Account Users do not disclose any DIN. Company is liable for any Unauthorized Use that results if an Account User or other employee discloses a DIN or writes a DIN on a Card, even if the disclosure is inadvertent or unintentional. Company shall not provide actual, implied or apparent authority to any Person to use a Card or the Account except for an Account User.
3. Credit Limit and Authorizations.
3.1 Issuer will notify Company of the Credit Limit assigned to the Account. Company shall ensure that the balance of the Account does not exceed the assigned Credit Limit. Issuer may change the Credit Limit in its sole discretion without prior notice, except as may be required by applicable law. Issuer may, but is not required to, permit Company to exceed its Credit Limit. Company must comply with the Credit Limit even if Issuer has previously permitted Company to exceed the Credit Limit. Company shall, immediately upon request, pay the amount over the Credit Limit.
3.2 Issuer has sole discretion to determine whether to establish an Account and extend credit to Company. Issuer may suspend an Account or refuse to authorize any Transaction in its sole discretion for any reason, including in the event that: (a) any balance is past due; or (b) the amount of the Transaction plus the outstanding balance (including Transactions authorized but not yet posted) exceeds the Credit Limit.
4. Controls.
4.1 Company may request that Controls be applied to the Account. The availability and effectiveness of Controls is dependent upon each merchant’s adoption of Card specifications and the information, including product codes that the merchant transmits to Issuer. The product codes are assigned by each merchant and not by Issuer. In addition, some Controls are not enforceable at island card readers due to equipment restrictions at the merchant location. There are inherent limitations on the ability of Controls to limit the use of Cards in the manner intended.
4.2 Issuer may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, modify Controls for the purpose of, among others, the prevention of suspected fraudulent activity. Issuer may apply default Controls on its portfolio of accounts. Issuer will use reasonable efforts to notify Company after any modification to a Control setting is made. Company shall review and manage the account set-up for all Cards based on Company’s specific purchasing needs. Company agrees it is responsible for reviewing fraud control data provided by Issuer for the purpose of detecting fraud that may occur within Control parameters.
4.3 Default Control values are modified through the online product. More detailed information and certain limitations regarding Controls is provided online. Only Transactions submitted for authorization are subject to Controls and those Controls can only be enforced when the merchant provides sufficient information as part of the authorization.
4.4 Controls are provided for the convenience of Company in its efforts to manage usage of Cards and the Account. Issuer encourages Company to set Controls in a
manner that Company determines is most likely to conform usage of Cards and the Account to the purposes determined by Company. However, Issuer is not responsible for the prudence of any particular Control level selected by Company. Company shall be liable for all Transactions, regardless of Control settings selected by Company or the effectiveness of the Controls, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or under applicable law.
5. Billing and Payments.
5.1 Issuer will provide Company with a billing statement for each Billing Cycle in which the Account has activity. Company agrees to pay Issuer in full on or before the relevant cutoff time on or before the Due Date. The Due Date generally will be between twenty-two (22) days and fourteen (14) days after the end of the Billing Cycle, as designated by Issuer at the time of Account setup, although there may be variations. Issuer strongly encourages Company to choose to receive billing statements electronically and make payments electronically to ensure that each payment posts by the relevant Due Date.
5.2 Company will pay Issuer for all credit extended under the Account, as well as any fees and charges, as provided in this Agreement. Company is liable for all Transactions on the Account to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. Company may pay the entire balance of the Account or a portion of it, at any time prior to its Due Date without penalty.
5.3 All payments must be made in United States dollars, using checks or similar payment instruments drawn on financial institutions in the United States or by payment through the Automated Clearing House network in accordance with Issuer’s requirements.
5.4 Payments made via paper check are posted to the Account after processing and must arrive at Issuer at least two Business Days before the Due Date on the billing statement. It can take up to two Business Days to process a check from the time the envelope containing a check arrives at Issuer’s facility to posting of the check amount to the Account.
5.5 For payments not made by paper check, payments on a Business Day before the cut-off time in this Section 5.5 (the “Cut-off Time”) will be posted on that Business Day. Payments after the Cut-off Time on a Business Day, or on a day other than a Business Day, will be posted on the following Business Day. The Cut-off Times for payments not made by check are as follows: a payment transaction made via Issuer’s online payment portal must be completed by 3:00 p.m. ET; a payment transaction made via IVR must be completed by 3:00 p.m. ET; and a payment transaction made via ACH must arrive to Issuer by 3:00 p.m. ET.
5.6 Regardless of payment method, Company must ensure that Company’s account number is provided with the payment. Failure to do so will cause processing delays in posting the payment to the Account. Payments that are received at locations other than the address specified on the billing statement, or that do not otherwise comply with instructions on the billing statement or the Agreement, may be delayed in posting.
5.7 Payments will be applied first to fees and then to other amounts owing on the Account. Issuer, in its sole discretion, may determine when to restore available credit in the Credit Limit after crediting a payment to an Account.
5.8 Company may be offered discounts and/or rebates from time to time. Such discounts and/or rebates may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice and may not be applicable to all fuel types. In addition, certain conditions in order to earn or receive the rebate or discount, such as but not limited to, maintaining the Company’s Account in good standing, will apply and be provided to Company when such offers are made.
6. Reports.
Issuer provides Transaction data for the Account to the Company as transmitted by merchants. Company is responsible for reconciling that data. Issuer will report the data received from merchants and as such is not liable for the accuracy or completeness of the data received, posted, or contained in any specialty reports, management reports, data services, or other information services provided. In addition, Company understands that in the event an error is identified in a report, such as an incorrect product code, Company is still liable for the Transaction, but may follow the dispute process as described in this Agreement.
7. Late Fees.
7.1 If Company fails to make payment in full by the applicable Due Date, or a payment is returned (each a “Payment Default”), then a fee (the “Late Fee”) will apply to the Total Outstanding Balance (as defined below).  For Billing Cycles other than monthly, the percentage rate used in the Late Fee calculation will be prorated based on the length of the billing cycle in relation to a monthly billing cycle. Company will be considered to have made a payment to Issuer on an Account only when the payment is posted to the Account as provided in this Agreement.
7.2 The “Calculation Date” is the earlier of (a) the posting date for Company’s payment in full of the invoiced amount to its Account, or (b) the last day of the Billing Cycle during which the Payment Default occurred. The “Total Outstanding Balance” is the invoiced amount, plus the amount of any unbilled Transactions delivered by a merchant to Issuer, and minus any credits that have posted to the Account, through the Calculation Date.
7.3 Issuer will not charge a Late Fee if the unpaid portion of the invoice as of the
Due Date is $10 or less.
8. Other Fees.
In addition to Late Fees, Company agrees to pay the additional fees in the amounts
and as described on the Fee Schedule.
9. Disputed Amounts.
9.1 Company shall use its best efforts to resolve any disputes regarding
Transactions directly with the relevant merchant, including any dispute related to
the quality of goods or services that are purchased in a Transaction or any warranty
received in connection with a Transaction.
9.2 All billed charges must be paid in full regardless of reported disputes. Charges
must be disputed in writing within sixty (60) days from the billing date or they will be
final and binding. Company may dispute an amount reflected on a billing statement
if: (a) the amount does not reflect the face value of the Transaction; (b) the amount
being disputed is a fee that is not properly accrued under this Agreement; or (c)
Company does not believe it is liable for that amount.
9.3 Transactions made at an island card reader where Company or Account User
did not obtain a receipt at the time of sale are eligible for dispute. However, the
receipt may provide the only opposing record to the Transaction information
submitted by the merchant. In addition, island card reader Transactions require both
a valid Card and DIN to be authorized and often disputes regarding such transaction
are the result of an Account User failing to comply with limits on Card usage imposed
by Company, which does not constitute Unauthorized Use or relieve Company from
liability for the Transaction.
9.4 Certain Transactions in dispute may qualify for charge back to the merchant.
Issuer will use reasonable efforts to charge the Transaction back to the merchant in
accordance with Issuer’s procedures under its merchant acceptance agreement
with the merchant. Any charge back paid by the merchant to Issuer will be credited
to the relevant Account. Company may be liable for the Transaction if the disputed
item cannot be charged back to the merchant.
10. Unauthorized Use.
10.1 If Company or an Account User knows of or suspects the loss or theft of a Card
or Account or possible Unauthorized Use, or if Company would like to terminate
authority of an Account User to use a Card or Account, Company will notify Issuer
by immediately. Company shall adopt and maintain
reasonable security precautions and controls to prevent Unauthorized Use.
10.2 Except as provided in Section 10.3, Company will be liable to Issuer for all
Unauthorized Use of a Card or Account: (a) that occurs before Company provides
Issuer with notice that a Card is lost or stolen or other possible Unauthorized Use
of an Account provided in Section 10.1 of this Agreement; or (b) Issuer determines
that such Unauthorized Use would have been prevented by Company adopting and
following reasonable security precautions and controls surrounding the Cards or
Accounts as described in Sections 1, 4 and 10.1 of this Agreement. A failure by an
Account User to comply with Company’s internal policy regarding use of an Account
or Card does not, by itself, result in Unauthorized Use of an Account or Card.
10.3 If Issuer has provided Company with fewer than ten (10) Cards to access the
Account, Company’s liability for Unauthorized Use of a Card will be limited to the
lesser of fifty dollars ($50) or the amount of money, property, labor or services
obtained by the Unauthorized Use of the Card before notification is provided to
Issuer of a lost or stolen Card or potential Unauthorized Use of a Card. The limitation
on liability for Unauthorized Use of a Card as described in this Section 10.3 shall
apply irrespective of any other provision of this Agreement and this Section 10.3
shall control in the event of any inconsistency between this Section 10.3 and any
other provision of this Agreement.
10.4 Company will use reasonable efforts to recover a Card from any Person whose
authority to use Company’s Account has terminated or from any unauthorized
individual with possession of or access to a Card. Company will give Issuer and any
law enforcement authority reasonable assistance with any investigation and
prosecution with respect to Unauthorized Use, including without limitation, obtaining
an affidavit or similar written, signed statement from the applicable Account User.
11. Representations by Company.
Company represents and warrants to Issuer that: (a) this Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid, binding, and enforceable agreement of Company; and (b) that
Company’s execution and performance of this Agreement (i) does not constitute a
breach of any agreement between Company and a Person other than Issuer, or of
any duty arising in law or equity, (ii) does not violate any law, rule or regulation
applicable to Company, and (iii) if Company is an organization, is within the
organizational powers of Company and has been authorized by all necessary
organizational action of Company.
12. Other Obligations of Company.
12.1 Company shall provide information requested by Issuer for purposes of
Issuer’s compliance with federal law related to customer identification and
verification, including, but not limited to, name, address, date of birth, and other
application information to identify the Company and/or Account Users.
12.2 Issuer may investigate the financial condition of Company and its subsidiaries
and affiliates at any time. If requested, Company agrees to furnish Issuer copies of
its official and finalized financial statements or other applicable financial information
no later than one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of each of its fiscal
years. The financial statements shall have been prepared, consistently year-overyear
and shall be in accordance with the books and records of Company. Any
financial information submitted shall be kept confidential by Issuer in accordance
with Section 20.
12.3 Company agrees to provide written notice (a) in advance of any change to its
legal name or in the ownership of Company, (b) in advance of any change in the
organizational structure of Company, including any merger or reorganization, or
sale of substantially all of Company’s assets, (c) immediately if Company becomes
insolvent or the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, or (d) immediately
after any appointment of a receiver or trustee for the benefit of creditors of
Company.
13. Amendment.
Company agrees that Issuer may change the rates, charges, and other terms of this
Agreement, including the Fee Schedule, as well as introduce new terms and fees to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Issuer will provide Company with
any notice of such change as required by applicable law. Any change in the terms
and conditions of the Account may be applied to the outstanding balance on the
Account to the extent permitted by applicable law.
14. Term and Termination.
14.1 This Agreement is effective when a Card is issued to Company or Issuer opens
an Account for Company and shall remain in effect until terminated by a Party.
Company and Issuer each shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for any
reason. Issuer’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 14.1 are
in addition to Issuer’s termination rights under Section 15 if Company is in Default
and under Section 14.5 in connection with the termination or modification of
products or services.
14.2 Company shall exercise its termination right under Section 14.1 by providing
written notice to Issuer. Issuer shall have a reasonable amount of time to terminate
the Account after receiving a notice of termination from Company. Issuer shall
provide Company with any notice required by applicable law in connection with the
exercise of its termination right under Section 14.1.
14.3 Company shall not use a Card or the Account to make a purchase after
termination of this Agreement. Company shall return to Issuer, or provide verification
of the destruction of, all Account numbers or Cards. Company may retain a copy of
any records or Account information for archival or data retention purposes.
14.4 The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue to apply until all
amounts owing with respect to the Account are paid in full and Company has
performed all of its obligations under this Agreement. As a result, after termination,
Company remains obligated to pay for all amounts owing on an Account and
charged under this Agreement after termination. Section 19 (Arbitration), Section 20
(Confidentiality) and Section 21 (Program Information) shall survive indefinitely.
14.5 Issuer may, for any reason, elect to terminate or modify any product or service
described in this Agreement, or provided in connection with the Account in which
Company or an Account User has enrolled, upon such notice (if any) as may be
required by applicable law.
15. Default by Company.
15.1 Company will be in “Default” under this Agreement if: (a) Company fails to
perform any obligation under this Agreement; (b) a representation or warranty by
Company in connection with this Agreement was incorrect or misleading when
made; (c) any petition in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or reorganization or
proceeding pursuant to any other debtor relief law is filed by or against Company;
(d) any order is entered appointing a receiver, custodian, trustee, liquidator, or any
other person with similar authority over the assets of Company; (e) there is an

15.2 If Company is in Default: (a) Company will not have any further right to borrow
under this Agreement; (b) Issuer may declare all outstanding amounts under the
Account to be immediately due and payable; (c) Issuer may terminate this
Agreement; and (d) Issuer will have the right to bring suit and exercise all rights and
remedies available under applicable law. In addition, if Company is in Default, Issuer
may, in its sole discretion, suspend all services and obligations, shorten the billing
cycle, and change the payment terms. A suspension of services or obligations will
not be deemed a waiver of any right to terminate this Agreement, whether as a result
of the Default to which such suspension of services or obligations relates or
otherwise. Company agrees to pay any and all costs (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees) incurred by Issuer in enforcing Company’s obligations under this
Agreement.
16. Foreign Transactions.
16.1 Cards are issued for use by Company’s operations based in the United States,
but may be used in Canada. Company may not distribute a Card to a Person based
in a country other than the United States. If a Card is used in any country other than
the United States, Company will: (a) be billed in U.S. Dollars; (b) receive reporting
in English; and (c) pay the currency conversion fee as reflected in the Fee
Schedule.
16.2 Issuer will convert any Transaction made in a foreign currency into a U.S.
Dollar amount before the Transaction is posted to the Account. The exchange rate
between the Transaction currency (the foreign currency) and the billing currency
(U.S. Dollars) used for processing an international Transaction is a rate selected by
Issuer using rates available in wholesale currency markets for the date that the
Transaction is posted by Issuer, which rate may vary from the rate Issuer itself
receives, or the government mandated rate in effect at that time. The conversion
rate used on the posting date may differ from the rate applicable on the date of the
Transaction.
17. Limitations on Liability.
Issuer shall not be liable for any loss sustained by Company or any other Person
resulting from any act or omission by Issuer or any other Person, whether with
respect to the exercise or enforcement of its rights or remedies under this
Agreement or otherwise, unless the loss is caused by Issuer’s gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Issuer’s liability shall be limited to actual damages incurred by
Company as a direct result of Issuer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Issuer’s liability for actual damages shall not exceed the sum of: (a) all fees paid by
Company to Issuer under this Agreement in the twelve (12) month period prior to
the date when any claim is made against Issuer; plus (b) all other revenue earned
by Issuer for all of Company’s Transactions made in the twelve (12) months prior to
the date of any claim made against Issuer. In no event will Issuer be liable for
incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages and Company expressly and
unconditionally waives any right to such damages. Except as otherwise required
under applicable law, Issuer makes no warranty with respect to goods, products,
merchantability, or services purchased with a Card or the Account, or through
Issuer. Issuer is not responsible for any failure of a merchant to accept the Account
or a Card.
17.1 Issuer is not liable to Company for any loss, liability or damages that Company
suffers as a result of, related to, or in any way are connected with any fraud control
or purchase restriction measures Issuer elects to implement from time to time,
unless such loss, liability or damage is a direct result of Issuer’s gross negligence
or willful misconduct.
18. Waivers.
18.1 THE PARTIES AGREE VOLUNTARILY, INTENTIONALLYAND
IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
PROCEEDING INSTITUTED IN ANY COURT, ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT.
18.2 Company waives personal service of process in connection with any action or
proceeding commenced by Issuer in connection with this Agreement, and agrees
that service may be made by certified mail to the last known address in Issuer’s
records.
19. ARBITRATION.
PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.
19.1 This section provides that disputes may be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration replaces the right to go to court, have a jury trial or initiate or participate
in a class action. In arbitration, disputes are resolved by an arbitrator, not a judge
or jury. Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than in court. This
arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and shall be
interpreted in the broadest way the law will allow.
19.2 Covered Claims. (a) Company or Issuer may arbitrate any claim, dispute or
controversy between Company and Issuer arising out of or related to this Account,
any previous related Account, the relationship between Company and Issuer, or any
other product or service provided by or through Issuer (called “Claims”). In this
Arbitration provision, the term “Issuer” includes any of Issuer’s affiliates that provide
or are involved in providing any products or services to Company and the term
“Company” includes any Guarantor. Claims include disputes relating to incentives
or benefits relating to the Account. A Person who asserts a Claim, or against whom
a Claim may be asserted, that is subject to this Arbitration provision may be referred
to as a “Covered Person.” (b) If arbitration is chosen by a Covered Person, then no
Covered Person will have the right to litigate that Claim in court or have a jury trial
on that Claim. (c) Except as stated below, all Claims are subject to arbitration, no
matter the legal theory on which they are based on or the remedy (damages, or
injunctive or declaratory relief) they seek, including Claims based on contract, tort
(including intentional tort), fraud, agency, any Person’s negligence, statutory or
regulatory provisions, or any other sources of law; Claims made as counterclaims,
cross-claims, third-party claims, interpleaders or otherwise; Claims made regarding
past, present or future conduct; and Claims made independently or with other
Claims. This also includes Claims made by or against any Person connected with
Company or Issuer, or by a Person making a Claim through Company or Issuer,
such as an Account User, employee, agent, representative or an
affiliated/parent/subsidiary company.
19.3 Arbitration Limits. (a) Individual Claims filed in a small claims court are not
subject to arbitration, as long as the matter stays in small claims court. (b) Claims
brought as part of a class action, private attorney general or other representative
action can be arbitrated only on an individual basis. The arbitrator has no authority
to arbitrate any claim on a class or representative basis and may award relief only
on an individual basis. If arbitration is chosen by any Covered Person, the Covered
Person asserting the Claim may not pursue the Claim as part of a class action or
other representative action. Claims of two (2) or more Persons may not be combined
in the same arbitration. However, applicants, Account Users on a single Account
and/or related Accounts or corporate affiliates are considered as one Person for
these purposes.
19.4 How Arbitration Works. (a) Arbitration shall be conducted by the American
Arbitration Association (“AAA”) according to this arbitration provision and the
applicable AAA arbitration rules in effect when the claim is filed (“AAA Rules”),
except where those rules conflict with this arbitration provision. The AAA Rules may
be obtained at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) or by calling 800-778-7879. A
Covered Person may choose to have a hearing, appear at any hearing by phone or
other electronic means, and/or be represented by counsel. Any in-person hearing
will be held in the same city as the U.S. District Court closest to Company’s billing
address. (b) If the AAA is not available to conduct the arbitration, then a Covered
Person may petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to designate an appropriate
arbitrator. (c) Arbitration may be requested at any time, even where there is a
pending lawsuit, unless a trial has begun or a final judgment entered. A Covered
Person does not waive the right to arbitrate by filing or serving a complaint, answer,
counterclaim, motion or discovery in a court lawsuit. To choose arbitration, a
Covered Person may file a motion to compel arbitration in a pending matter and/or
commence arbitration by submitting the required AAA forms and requisite filing fees
to the AAA. (d) The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator in accord
with this arbitration provision and the AAA Rules, which may limit discovery. The
arbitrator shall not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure for discovery,
but the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law and shall take
reasonable steps to protect Account information and other confidential information
of a Covered Person if requested to do so. The arbitrator shall apply applicable
substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statute of limitations, and
may award damages or other relief under applicable law. (e) The arbitrator shall
make any award in writing and, if requested by a Covered Person, shall provide a
brief statement of the reasons for the award. An arbitration award shall decide the
rights and obligations only of the Persons named in the arbitration, and shall not
have any bearing on any other Person or dispute.
19.5 Paying for Arbitration. Arbitration fees will be allocated according to the
applicable AAA Rules. All Persons are responsible for their own attorney’s fees,
expert fees and any other expenses, unless the arbitrator awards such fees or
expenses to a Person based on applicable law.
19.6 The Final Award. (a) Any award by an arbitrator is final unless a Covered
Person appeals it in writing to the AAA within thirty (30) days of notice of the award.
The arbitration appeal shall be determined by a panel of three (3) arbitrators. The
panel will consider all facts and legal issues anew based on the same evidence
presented in the prior arbitration, and will make decisions based on a majority vote.
Arbitration fees for the arbitration appeal shall be allocated according to the
applicable AAA Rules. An award by a panel on appeal is final. A final award is
subject to judicial review as provided by applicable law. (b) A final award may be
entered in any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
19.7 If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the
other terms shall remain in force, except that there can be no arbitration of a class
or representative Claim. This arbitration provision may not be amended, severed or
waived, except as provided in this Agreement or in a written agreement between
Company and Issuer.
20. Confidentiality.
All information furnished by either Party or by any affiliate of Issuer in connection
with this Agreement will be kept confidential (and will be used by the other Party
only in connection with this Agreement), except to the extent that the information:
(a) is already lawfully known when received; (b) becomes lawfully obtainable from
other sources; (c) is required to be disclosed in any document filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
or any other agency of any government; (d) is disclosed by Issuer to its financial
services regulators; (e) is used or disclosed as provided in this Agreement or with
the consent of the Person whose information is being used or disclosed; or (f) is
required by law to be disclosed, provided that notice of the disclosure has been
given (when legally permissible) by the Party proposing to make such disclosure,
which notice, when practicable, shall be given sufficiently in advance of the
proposed disclosure to permit the other Party to take legal action to prevent the
disclosure. Nothing in this section or this Agreement prohibits Issuer from providing
any information to its affiliates or third-party servicers related to the operation and
maintenance of the business of Issuer and its affiliates, and Company expressly
agrees to these disclosures and use of information, provided that such affiliates and
third-party servicers agree to maintain the information confidentially and not
disclose it to any other parties without Issuer’s authorization.
21. Program Information.
Transaction information related to the Account may be provided to merchants who
accept the Card as payment for goods and services. Issuer and its affiliates may
use and disclose information obtained by Issuer in operating its card programs,
including Transaction information and/or identifiable information of the Company
(collectively, “Program Information”) for the purpose of operating Issuer’s and its
affiliates’ business, delivering, improving, and customizing their respective services,
sending communications related to their respective business, and for other
legitimate purposes permitted by applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing,
Issuer may provide Program Information to its affiliates and third parties which
provide goods or services to commercial enterprises and Company understands
that Issuer, its affiliates, including but not limited to WEX Inc., and third parties may
contact Company to offer additional products or services including, for example,
discount networks for certain non-fuel merchant purchases and telematics
products designed to assist customers with vehicle tracking and management. If
Company chooses to enroll in any such product or service offered by Issuer, its
affiliates or a third party, Company may be required to complete additional
enrollment forms or agreements, and/or agree to additional terms and conditions
(which may include fees for use) with respect to such products or services. For
more information on Issuer’s privacy policy, please visit the website at:
https://www.wexinc.com/privacy-policy/. Issuer and its affiliates may use and
disclose Program Information that is not identifiable to Company in industry
analytics and other data services or products provided to third parties. Program
Information shall be subject to this Section 21 (Program Information) and not
Section 20 (Confidentiality).
22. Assignment.
Company may not assign this Agreement or any interest, rights or obligations under
this Agreement, without Issuer’s prior written consent. Issuer may, in its sole
discretion, assign this Agreement and any of its obligations, transfer any right, or
delegate any duty of performance under this Agreement without further notice. The
Person to whom Issuer makes any assignment is entitled to all of Issuer’s rights
under this Agreement, to the extent that those rights were assigned.
23. Miscellaneous.
23.1 Company may purchase dyed special fuel using its Account or Cards.
